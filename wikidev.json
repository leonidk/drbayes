[["Pain , which can vary in severity , is a common symptom in virtually all types of *$%^ . Other symptoms include swelling , joint stiffness and aching around the joint ( s ) . Arthritic disorders like lupus and rheumatoid *$%^ can affect other organs in the body , leading to a variety of symptoms . [ 9 ] Symptoms may include : Inability to use the hand or walk Stiffness , which may be worse in the morning , or after use Malaise and fatigue Weight loss Poor sleep Muscle aches and pains Tenderness Difficulty moving the joint It is common in advanced *$%^ for significant secondary changes to occur . For example , arthritic symptoms might make it difficult for a person to move around and/or exercise , which can lead to secondary effects , such as : Muscle weakness Loss of flexibility Decreased aerobic fitness These changes , in addition to the primary symptoms , can have a huge impact on quality of life . *$%^ is the most common cause of disability in the USA . More than 20 million individuals with *$%^ have severe limitations in function on a daily basis . [ 10 ] Absenteeism and frequent visits to the physician are common in individuals who have *$%^ . *$%^ can make it very difficult for individuals to be physically active and some become home bound . It is estimated that the total cost of *$%^ cases is close to $ 100 billion of which almost 50 % is from lost earnings . Each year , *$%^ results in nearly 1 million hospitalizations and close to 45 million outpatient visits to health care centers . [ 11 ] Decreased mobility , in combination with the above symptoms , can make it difficult for an individual to remain physically active , contributing to an increased risk of obesity , high cholesterol or vulnerability to heart disease . [ 12 ] People with *$%^ are also at increased risk of depression , which may be a response to numerous factors , including fear of worsening symptoms . [ 13 ]", "Arthritis"], ["Mania is the defining feature of *$%^ *$%^ , [ 7 ] and can occur with different levels of severity . With milder levels of mania , known as hypomania , individuals appear energetic , excitable , and may be highly productive . [ 8 ] As mania worsens , individuals begin to exhibit erratic and impulsive behavior , often making poor decisions due to unrealistic ideas about the future , and sleep very little . [ 8 ] At the most severe level , manic individuals can experience very distorted beliefs about the world known as psychosis . [ 8 ] A depressive episode commonly follows an episode of mania . [ 8 ] The biological mechanisms responsible for switching from a manic or hypomanic episode to a depressive episode or vice versa remain poorly understood . [ 9 ] Mania is a distinct period of at least one week of elevated or irritable mood , which can take the form of euphoria , and exhibit three or more of the following behaviors ( four if irritable ) : speak in a rapid , uninterruptible manner , are easily distracted , have racing thoughts , display an increase in goal-oriented activities or feel agitated , or exhibit behaviors characterized as impulsive or high-risk such as hypersexuality or excessive money spending . [ 7 ] To meet the definition for a manic episode , these behaviors must impair the individual 's ability to socialize or work . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] If untreated , a manic episode usually lasts three to six months . [ 10 ] People with mania may also experience a decreased need for sleep , speak excessively in addition to speaking rapidly , and may have impaired judgment . [ 8 ] [ 11 ] Manic individuals often have issues with substance abuse due to a combination of thrill-seeking and poor judgment . [ 12 ] At more extreme levels , a person in a manic state can experience psychosis , or a break with reality , a state in which thinking is affected along with mood . [ 8 ] They may feel out of control or unstoppable , or as if they have been `` chosen '' and are on a special mission , or have other grandiose or delusional ideas . [ 13 ] Approximately 50 % of those with *$%^ *$%^ experience delusions or hallucinations . [ 14 ] This may lead to violent behaviors and hospitalization in an inpatient psychiatric hospital . [ 8 ] [ 11 ] The severity of manic symptoms can be measured by rating scales such as the Young Mania Rating Scale . [ 11 ] [ 15 ] The onset of a manic ( or depressive ) episode is often foreshadowed by sleep disturbances . [ 16 ] Mood changes , psychomotor and appetite changes , and an increase in anxiety can also occur up to three weeks before a manic episode develops . [ 17 ] Hypomania is a milder form of mania defined as at least four days of the same criteria as mania , [ 8 ] but does not cause a significant decrease in the individual 's ability to socialize or work , lacks psychotic features ( i.e. , delusions or hallucinations ) , and does not require psychiatric hospitalization . [ 7 ] Overall functioning may actually increase during episodes of hypomania and is thought to serve as a defense mechanism against depression . [ 18 ] Hypomanic episodes rarely progress to true manic episodes . [ 18 ] Some hypomanic people show increased creativity [ 8 ] while others are irritable or demonstrate poor judgment . Hypomanic people generally have increased energy and increased activity levels . Hypomania may feel good to the person who experiences it . [ 8 ] Thus , even when family and friends recognize mood swings , the individual will often deny that anything is wrong . [ 19 ] What might be called a `` hypomanic event '' , if not accompanied by depressive episodes , is often not deemed as problematic , unless the mood changes are uncontrollable , volatile or mercurial . [ 18 ] Most commonly , symptoms continue for a few weeks to a few months . [ 20 ] Signs and symptoms of the depressive phase of *$%^ *$%^ include persistent feelings of sadness , anxiety , guilt , anger , isolation , or hopelessness ; [ 21 ] disturbances in sleep and appetite ; fatigue and loss of interest in usually enjoyable activities ; problems concentrating ; loneliness , self-loathing , apathy or indifference ; depersonalization ; loss of interest in sexual activity ; shyness or social anxiety ; irritability , chronic pain ( with or without a known cause ) ; lack of motivation ; and morbid suicidal thoughts . [ 21 ] In severe cases , the individual may become psychotic , a condition also known as severe *$%^ depression with psychotic features . These symptoms include delusions or , less commonly , hallucinations , which are usually frightening and/or intimidating . A major depressive episode persists for at least two weeks , and may continue for over six months if left untreated . [ 22 ] The earlier the age of onset , the more likely the first few episodes are to be depressive . [ 23 ] Because a *$%^ diagnosis requires a manic or hypomanic episode , many patients are initially diagnosed and treated as having major depression . [ 24 ] In the context of *$%^ *$%^ , a mixed state is a condition during which symptoms of both mania and depression occur at the same time . [ 25 ] Individuals experiencing a mixed state may have manic symptoms such as grandiose thoughts while at the same time experiencing depressive symptoms such as excessive guilt or feeling suicidal . [ 25 ] Mixed states are considered to be high-risk for suicidal behavior since depressive emotions such as hopelessness are often paired with mood swings or difficulties with impulse control . [ 25 ] Anxiety *$%^ occurs more frequently as a comorbidity in mixed *$%^ episodes than in non mixed *$%^ depression or mania . [ 25 ] Substance abuse ( including alcohol ) also follows this trend . [ 25 ] Associated features are clinical phenomena that often accompany the *$%^ but are not part of the diagnostic criteria . In adults with the condition , *$%^ *$%^ is often accompanied by changes in cognitive processes and abilities . These include reduced attentional and executive capabilities and impaired memory . How the individual processes the world also depends on the phase of the *$%^ , with differential characteristics between the manic , hypomanic and depressive states . [ 17 ] Some studies have found a significant association between *$%^ *$%^ and creativity . [ 26 ] Those with *$%^ *$%^ may have difficulty in maintaining relationships . [ 27 ] There are several common childhood precursors seen in children who later receive a diagnosis of *$%^ *$%^ ; these disorders include mood abnormalities , full major depressive episodes , and attention deficit hyperactivity *$%^ ( ADHD ) . [ 28 ] The diagnosis of *$%^ *$%^ can be complicated by coexisting ( comorbid ) psychiatric conditions including the following : obsessive-compulsive *$%^ , substance abuse , eating disorders , attention deficit hyperactivity *$%^ , social phobia , premenstrual syndrome ( including premenstrual dysphoric *$%^ ) , or panic *$%^ . [ 12 ] [ 14 ] [ 21 ] [ 29 ] A careful longitudinal analysis of symptoms and episodes , enriched if possible by discussions with friends and family members , is crucial to establishing a treatment plan where these comorbidities exist . [ 30 ]", "Bipolar disorder"], ["The early ( prodromal ) symptoms in adolescents and adults are nausea , loss of appetite , aching muscles , and headache . This is followed by the characteristic rash or oral sores , malaise , and a low-grade fever that signal the presence of the disease . Oral manifestations of the disease ( enanthem ) not uncommonly may precede the external rash ( exanthem ) . In children the illness is not usually preceded by prodromal symptoms , and the first sign is the rash or the spots in the oral cavity . The rash begins as small red dots on the face , scalp , torso , upper arms and legs ; progressing over 10\u201312 hours to small bumps , blisters and pustules ; followed by umbilication and the formation of scabs . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] At the blister stage , intense itching is usually present . Blisters may also occur on the palms , soles , and genital area . Commonly , visible evidence of the disease develops in the oral cavity and tonsil areas in the form of small ulcers which can be painful or itchy or both ; this enanthem ( internal rash ) can precede the exanthem ( external rash ) by 1 to 3 days or can be concurrent . These symptoms of *$%^ appear 10 to 21 days after exposure to a contagious person . Adults may have a more widespread rash and longer fever , and they are more likely to experience complications , such as varicella pneumonia . [ 12 ] Because watery nasal discharge containing live virus usually precedes both exanthem ( external rash ) and enanthem ( oral ulcers ) by 1 to 2 days , the infected person actually becomes contagious one to two days before recognition of the disease . Contagiousness persists until all vesicular lesions have become dry crusts ( scabs ) , which usually entails four or five days , by which time nasal shedding of live virus ceases . The condition usually resolves by itself within a couple of weeks . [ 14 ] The rash may , however , last for up to one month , although the infectious stage does not last longer than a week or two . [ citation needed ] *$%^ is rarely fatal , although it is generally more severe in adult men than in women or children . Non-immune pregnant women and those with a suppressed immune system are at highest risk of serious complications . Arterial ischemic stroke ( AIS ) associated with *$%^ in the previous year accounts for nearly one third of childhood AIS . [ 15 ] The most common late complication of *$%^ is shingles ( herpes zoster ) , caused by reactivation of the varicella zoster virus decades after the initial , often childhood , *$%^ infection . The back of a 30-year-old male after five days of the rash The back of a 30-year-old male after five days of the rash A 3-year-old girl with a *$%^ rash on her torso A 3-year-old girl with a *$%^ rash on her torso An Indian child with *$%^ at an orphanage in Howrah An Indian child with *$%^ at an orphanage in Howrah Lower leg of a child with *$%^ Lower leg of a child with *$%^ During pregnancy the dangers to the fetus associated with a primary VZV infection are greater in the first six months . In the third trimester , the mother is more likely to have severe symptoms . [ 16 ] For pregnant women , antibodies produced as a result of immunization or previous infection are transferred via the placenta to the fetus . [ 17 ] Women who are immune to *$%^ can not become infected and do not need to be concerned about it for themselves or their infant during pregnancy . [ 18 ] Varicella infection in pregnant women could lead to spread via the placenta and infection of the fetus . If infection occurs during the first 28 weeks of gestation , this can lead to fetal varicella syndrome ( also known as congenital varicella syndrome ) . [ 19 ] Effects on the fetus can range in severity from underdeveloped toes and fingers to severe anal and bladder malformation . Possible problems include : Damage to brain : encephalitis , [ 20 ] microcephaly , hydrocephaly , [ 21 ] aplasia of brain Damage to the eye : optic stalk , optic cup , and lens vesicles , microphthalmia , cataracts , chorioretinitis , optic atrophy Other neurological disorder : damage to cervical and lumbosacral spinal cord , motor/sensory deficits , absent deep tendon reflexes , anisocoria/Horner 's syndrome Damage to body : hypoplasia of upper/lower extremities , anal and bladder sphincter dysfunction Skin disorders : ( cicatricial ) skin lesions , hypopigmentation Infection late in gestation or immediately following birth is referred to as `` neonatal varicella '' . [ 22 ] Maternal infection is associated with premature delivery . The risk of the baby developing the disease is greatest following exposure to infection in the period 7 days before delivery and up to 8 days following the birth . The baby may also be exposed to the virus via infectious siblings or other contacts , but this is of less concern if the mother is immune . Newborns who develop symptoms are at a high risk of pneumonia and other serious complications of the disease . [ 23 ]", "Chickenpox"], ["The human *$%^ occurs in two stages : an acute stage , which occurs shortly after an initial infection , and a chronic stage that develops over many years . The acute phase lasts for the first few weeks or months of infection . It usually occurs unnoticed because it is symptom-free or exhibits only mild symptoms that are not unique to *$%^ *$%^ . These can include fever , fatigue , body aches , muscle pain , headache , rash , loss of appetite , diarrhea , nausea , and vomiting . The signs on physical examination can include mild enlargement of the liver or spleen , swollen glands , and local swelling ( a chagoma ) where the parasite entered the body . [ 10 ] The most recognized marker of acute *$%^ *$%^ is called Roma\u00f1a 's sign , which includes swelling of the eyelids on the side of the face near the bite wound or where the bug feces were deposited or accidentally rubbed into the eye . Rarely , young children , or adults may die from the acute *$%^ due to severe inflammation/infection of the heart muscle ( myocarditis ) or brain ( meningoencephalitis ) . [ 10 ] The acute phase also can be severe in people with weakened immune systems . [ 4 ] If symptoms develop during the acute phase , they usually resolve spontaneously within three to eight weeks in approximately 90 % of individuals . [ 2 ] [ 6 ] Although the symptoms resolve , even with treatment the infection persists and enters a chronic phase . Of individuals with chronic *$%^ *$%^ , 60\u201380 % will never develop symptoms ( called indeterminate chronic *$%^ *$%^ ) , while the remaining 20\u201340 % will develop life-threatening heart and/or digestive disorders during their lifetime ( called determinate chronic *$%^ *$%^ ) . In 10 % of individuals , the *$%^ progresses directly from the acute form to a symptomatic clinical form of chronic *$%^ *$%^ . [ 2 ] [ 6 ] The symptomatic ( determinate ) chronic stage affects the nervous system , digestive system and heart . About two-thirds of people with chronic symptoms have cardiac damage , including dilated cardiomyopathy , which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death . About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage , resulting in dilation of the digestive tract ( megacolon and megaesophagus ) , accompanied by severe weight loss . Swallowing difficulties ( secondary achalasia ) may be the first symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition . [ 11 ] 20 % to 50 % of individuals with intestinal involvement also exhibit cardiac involvement . [ 11 ] Up to 10 % of chronically infected individuals develop neuritis that results in altered tendon reflexes and sensory impairment . Isolated cases exhibit central nervous system involvement , including dementia , confusion , chronic encephalopathy and sensory and motor deficits . [ 12 ] The clinical manifestations of *$%^ *$%^ are due to cell death in the target tissues that occurs during the infective cycle , by sequentially inducing an inflammatory response , cellular lesions , and fibrosis . For example , intracellular amastigotes destroy the intramural neurons of the autonomic nervous system in the intestine and heart , leading to megaintestine and heart aneurysms , respectively . If left untreated , *$%^ *$%^ can be fatal , in most cases due to heart muscle damage . [ 11 ]", "Chagas disease"], ["The features of this *$%^ vary widely , even among members of the same family , and affect many parts of the body . Characteristic signs and symptoms may include birth defects such as congenital heart disease , defects in the palate , most commonly related to neuromuscular problems with closure ( velopharyngeal insufficiency ) , learning disabilities , mild differences in facial features , and recurrent infections . Infections are common in children due to problems with the immune system 's T-cell-mediated response that in some patients is due to an absent or hypoplastic thymus . 22q11.2 deletion *$%^ may be first spotted when an affected newborn has heart defects or convulsions from hypocalcemia due to malfunctioning parathyroid glands and low levels of parathyroid hormone ( parathormone ) . Affected individuals may also have other kinds of birth defect including kidney abnormalities and significant feeding difficulties as babies . Gastrointestinal issues are also very common in this patient population . Digestive motility issues may result in constipation . [ 16 ] Disorders such as hypothyroidism and hypoparathyroidism or thrombocytopenia ( low platelet levels ) , and psychiatric illnesses are common late-occurring features . [ 17 ] Microdeletions in chromosomal region 22q11.2 are associated with a 20 to 30-fold increased risk of schizophrenia . [ 18 ] Studies provide various rates of 22q11.2 deletion *$%^ in schizophrenia , ranging from 0.5 to 2.0 % and averaging about 1.0 % , compared with the overall estimated 0.025 % risk of the 22q11.2 deletion *$%^ in the general population . [ 19 ] Salient features can be summarized using the mnemonic CATCH-22 to describe *$%^ *$%^ , with the 22 to remind one the chromosomal abnormality is found on the 22 chromosome , as below : [ 20 ] Cardiac abnormality ( especially tetralogy of Fallot ) Abnormal facies Thymic aplasia Cleft palate Hypocalcemia/Hypoparathyroidism Individuals with a 22q11.2 deletion can have many possible features , ranging in number of associated features and from the mild to the very serious . Symptoms shown to be common include : Congenital heart disease ( 40 % of individuals ) , particularly conotruncal malformations ( tetralogy of Fallot , interrupted aortic arch , ventricular septal defect , and persistent truncus arteriosus ) Cyanosis ( bluish skin due to poor circulation of oxygen-rich blood ) Palatal abnormalities ( 50 % ) , particularly velopharyngeal incompetence , submucosal cleft palate , and cleft palate ; characteristic facial features ( present in the majority of Caucasian individuals ) including hypertelorism Learning difficulties ( 90 % ) , including cognitive deficits , attention deficit disorders [ 21 ] Hypocalcemia ( 50 % ) ( due to hypoparathyroidism ) Significant feeding problems ( 30 % ) Renal anomalies ( 37 % ) Hearing loss ( both conductive and sensorineural ) ( hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes ) Laryngotracheoesophageal anomalies Growth hormone deficiency Autoimmune disorders Immune disorders due to reduced T cell numbers Seizures ( with or without hypocalcemia ) Skeletal abnormalities Psychiatric disorders [ 21 ] This *$%^ is characterized by incomplete penetrance and therefore there is a marked variability in clinical expression between the different patients . This often makes early diagnosis difficult . [ 3 ] Children with 22q11.2 have a specific profile in neuropsychological tests . They usually have a below-borderline normal IQ , with most individuals having higher scores in the verbal than the nonverbal domains . Some are able to attend normal schools , while others are home-schooled or in special classes.The severity of hypocalcemia early in childhood is associated with autism-like behavioral difficulties . [ 22 ] Adults with *$%^ *$%^ have a specifically high-risk group for developing schizophrenia . About 30 % have at least one incident of psychosis and about a quarter develop actual schizophrenia . [ 23 ] Individuals with 22q11.2DS also have a higher risk of developing early onset Parkinson 's disease ( PD ) . Diagnosis of PD in 22q11.2DS patients can be delayed by up to 10 years due to the use of antipsychotics , which can cause parkinsonian symptoms . [ 24 ] Current research demonstrates a unique profile of speech and language impairments is associated with 22q11.2 deletion *$%^ . Children often perform lower on speech and language evaluations in comparison to their nonverbal IQ scores . [ contradictory ] Common problems include hypernasality , language delays , and speech sound errors . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 27 ] Hypernasality occurs when air escapes through the nose during the production of oral speech sounds , resulting in reduced intelligibility . This is a common characteristic in the speech and language profile because 69 % of children have palatal abnormalities . If the structure of the soft palate velum is such that it does not stop the flow of air from going up to the nasal cavity , it will cause hypernasal speech . This phenomenon is referred as velopharyngeal inadequacy ( VPI ) . Hearing loss can also contribute to increased hypernasality because children with hearing impairments can have difficulty self monitoring their oral speech output . The treatment options available for VPI include prosthesis and surgery . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] [ 28 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] Difficulties acquiring vocabulary and formulating spoken language ( expressive language deficits ) at the onset of language development are also part of the speech and language profile associated with the 22q11.2 deletion . Vocabulary acquisition is often severely delayed for preschool-age children . In some recent studies , children had a severely limited vocabulary or were still not verbal at 2\u20133 years of age . School-age children do make progress with expressive language as they mature , but many continue to have delays and demonstrate difficulty when presented with language tasks such as verbally recalling narratives and producing longer and more complex sentences . Receptive language , which is the ability to comprehend , retain , or process spoken language , can also be impaired , although not usually with the same severity as expressive language impairments . [ 26 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] [ 31 ] Articulation errors are commonly present in children with 22q11.2 deletion *$%^ . These errors include a limited phonemic ( speech sound ) inventory and the use of compensatory articulation strategies resulting in reduced intelligibility . The phonemic inventory typically produced consists of sounds made in the front or back of the oral cavity such as : /p/ , /w/ , /m/ , /n/ , and glottal stops . Sound made in the middle of the mouth are completely absent . Compensatory articulation errors made by this population of children include : glottal stops , nasal substitutions , pharyngeal fricatives , linguapalatal sibilants , reduced pressure on consonant sounds , or a combination of these symptoms . Of these errors , glottal stops have the highest frequency of occurrence . It is reasoned that a limited phonemic inventory and the use of compensatory articulation strategies is present due to the structural abnormalities of the palate . The speech impairments exhibited by this population are more severe during the younger ages and show a trend of gradual improvement as the child matures . [ 25 ] [ 29 ]", "DiGeorge syndrome"], ["In early childhood , symptoms that correlate with a later diagnosis of *$%^ include delayed onset of speech , difficulty distinguishing left from right , difficulty with direction , [ 22 ] as well as being easily distracted by background noise . [ 7 ] The reversal of letters or words and mirror writing are behaviors sometimes seen in people with *$%^ , but are not considered to be defining characteristics of the disorder . [ 7 ] *$%^ and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder ( ADHD ) commonly occur together ; [ 9 ] about 15 % of people with *$%^ also have ADHD and 35 % of those with ADHD have *$%^ . [ 7 ] School-age dyslexic children may exhibit signs of difficulty in identifying or generating rhyming words , or counting the number of syllables in words \u2013 both of which depend on phonological awareness . [ 23 ] They may also show difficulty in segmenting words into individual sounds or may blend sounds when producing words , indicating reduced phonemic awareness . [ 24 ] Difficulties with word retrieval or naming things is also associated with *$%^ . [ 25 ] :647 Dyslexics are commonly poor spellers , a feature sometimes called dysorthographia or dysgraphia , which depends on orthographic coding . [ 7 ] Problems persist into adolescence and adulthood and may accompany difficulties with summarizing stories , memorization , reading aloud , or learning foreign languages . Adult dyslexics can often read with good comprehension , though they tend to read more slowly than non-dyslexics and perform worse in spelling tests or when reading nonsense words \u2013 a measure of phonological awareness . [ 26 ] A common myth about *$%^ is that its defining feature is reading or writing letters or words backwards , but this is true of many children as they learn to read and write . [ 27 ] The orthographic complexity of a language directly impacts how difficult learning to read the language is . [ 28 ] :266 English and French have comparatively `` deep '' phonemic orthographies within the Latin alphabet writing system , with complex structures employing spelling patterns on several levels : letter-sound correspondence , syllables , and morphemes . [ 29 ] :421 Languages such as Spanish , Italian and Finnish have mostly alphabetic orthographies , which primarily employ letter-sound correspondence \u2013 so-called shallow orthographies \u2013 which for dyslexics makes them easier to learn . [ 28 ] :266 Logographic writing systems , such as Chinese characters , have extensive symbol use , and pose problems for dyslexic learners . [ 30 ] *$%^ is often accompanied by several learning disabilities , but it is unclear whether they share underlying neurological causes . [ 31 ] These associated disabilities include : Dysgraphia \u2013 A disorder which primarily expresses itself through difficulties with writing or typing , but in some cases through difficulties associated with eye\u2013hand coordination and direction- or sequence-oriented processes such as tying knots or carrying out repetitive tasks . [ 32 ] In *$%^ , dysgraphia is often multifactorial , due to impaired letter-writing automaticity , organizational and elaborative difficulties , and impaired visual word forming which makes it more difficult to retrieve the visual picture of words required for spelling . [ 32 ] Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder \u2013 A significant degree of comorbidity has been reported between ADHD and reading disorders such as *$%^ . [ 33 ] [ 34 ] ADHD occurs in 12\u201324 % of all individuals with *$%^ . [ 35 ] Auditory processing disorder \u2013 A listening disability that affects the ability to process auditory information . [ 36 ] [ 37 ] This can lead to problems with auditory memory and auditory sequencing . Many people with *$%^ have auditory processing problems , and may develop their own logographic cues to compensate for this type of deficit . Some research indicates that auditory processing skills could be the primary shortfall in *$%^ . [ 38 ] [ 39 ] Developmental coordination disorder \u2013 A neurological condition characterized by marked difficulty in carrying out routine tasks involving balance , fine-motor control , kinesthetic coordination , difficulty in the use of speech sounds , problems with short-term memory , and organization . [ 40 ]", "Dyslexia"], ["*$%^ is characterized by a long-term risk of recurrent seizures . [ 18 ] These seizures may present in several ways depending on the part of the brain involved and the person 's age . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] The most common type ( 60 % ) of seizures are convulsive . [ 19 ] Of these , one-third begin as generalized seizures from the start , affecting both hemispheres of the brain . [ 19 ] Two-thirds begin as partial seizures ( which affect one hemisphere of the brain ) which may then progress to generalized seizures . [ 19 ] The remaining 40 % of seizures are non-convulsive . An example of this type is the absence seizure , which presents as a decreased level of consciousness and usually lasts about 10 seconds . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Partial seizures are often preceded by certain experiences , known as auras . [ 22 ] They include sensory ( visual , hearing , or smell ) , psychic , autonomic , and motor phenomena . [ 20 ] Jerking activity may start in a specific muscle group and spread to surrounding muscle groups in which case it is known as a Jacksonian march . [ 23 ] Automatisms may occur , which are non-consciously-generated activities and mostly simple repetitive movements like smacking of the lips or more complex activities such as attempts to pick up something . [ 23 ] There are six main types of generalized seizures : tonic-clonic , tonic , clonic , myoclonic , absence , and atonic seizures . [ 24 ] They all involve loss of consciousness and typically happen without warning . Tonic-clonic seizures occur with a contraction of the limbs followed by their extension along with arching of the back which lasts 10\u201330 seconds ( the tonic phase ) . A cry may be heard due to contraction of the chest muscles , followed by a shaking of the limbs in unison ( clonic phase ) . Tonic seizures produce constant contractions of the muscles . A person often turns blue as breathing is stopped . In clonic seizures there is shaking of the limbs in unison . After the shaking has stopped it may take 10\u201330 minutes for the person to return to normal ; this period is called the `` postictal state '' or `` postictal phase . '' Loss of bowel or bladder control may occur during a seizure . [ 3 ] The tongue may be bitten at either the tip or on the sides during a seizure . [ 25 ] In tonic-clonic seizure , bites to the sides are more common . [ 25 ] Tongue bites are also relatively common in psychogenic non-epileptic seizures . [ 25 ] Myoclonic seizures involve spasms of muscles in either a few areas or all over . [ 26 ] Absence seizures can be subtle with only a slight turn of the head or eye blinking . [ 20 ] The person does not fall over and returns to normal right after it ends . [ 20 ] Atonic seizures involve the loss of muscle activity for greater than one second . [ 23 ] This typically occurs on both sides of the body . [ 23 ] About 6 % of those with *$%^ have seizures that are often triggered by specific events and are known as reflex seizures . [ 27 ] Those with reflex *$%^ have seizures that are only triggered by specific stimuli . [ 28 ] Common triggers include flashing lights and sudden noises . [ 27 ] In certain types of *$%^ , seizures happen more often during sleep , [ 29 ] and in other types they occur almost only when sleeping . [ 30 ] After the active portion of a seizure , there is typically a period of confusion referred to as the postictal period before a normal level of consciousness returns . [ 22 ] It usually lasts 3 to 15 minutes [ 31 ] but may last for hours . [ 32 ] Other common symptoms include feeling tired , headache , difficulty speaking , and abnormal behavior . [ 32 ] Psychosis after a seizure is relatively common , occurring in 6\u201310 % of people . [ 33 ] Often people do not remember what happened during this time . [ 32 ] Localized weakness , known as Todd 's paralysis , may also occur after a partial seizure . When it occurs it typically lasts for seconds to minutes but may rarely last for a day or two . [ 34 ] *$%^ can have adverse effects on social and psychological well-being . [ 19 ] These effects may include social isolation , stigmatization , or disability . [ 19 ] They may result in lower educational achievement and worse employment outcomes . [ 19 ] Learning difficulties are common in those with the condition , and especially among children with *$%^ . [ 19 ] The stigma of *$%^ can also affect the families of those with the disorder . [ 3 ] Certain disorders occur more often in people with *$%^ , depending partly on the *$%^ syndrome present . These include depression , anxiety disorders , and migraines . [ 35 ] Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder affects three to five times more children with *$%^ than children in the general population . [ 36 ] ADHD and *$%^ have significant consequences on a child 's behavioral , learning , and social development . [ 37 ] *$%^ is also more common in children with autism . [ 38 ]", "Epilepsy"], ["*$%^ which is associated with hypothyroidism or hyperthyroidism may be present with symptoms of the underlying disorder . For hyperthyroidism , the most common symptoms are associated with adrenergic stimulation : tachycardia , palpitations , nervousness , tremor , increased blood pressure and heat intolerance . Clinical manifestations are often related to hypermetabolism , including increased metabolism , excessive thyroid hormone , an increase in oxygen consumption , metabolic changes in protein metabolism , immunologic stimulation of diffuse *$%^ , and ocular changes ( exophthalmos ) . [ 2 ] Hypothyroid individuals may have weight gain despite poor appetite , cold intolerance , constipation and lethargy . However , these symptoms are often nonspecific and hard to diagnose .", "Goitre"], ["Hypoglycemic symptoms and manifestations can be divided into those produced by the counterregulatory hormones ( epinephrine/adrenaline and glucagon ) triggered by the falling glucose , and the neuroglycopenic effects produced by the reduced brain sugar .

In older children and adults , moderately severe *$%^ can resemble mania , mental illness , drug intoxication , or drunkenness . In the elderly , *$%^ can produce focal stroke-like effects or a hard-to-define malaise . The symptoms of a single person may be similar from episode to episode , but are not necessarily so and may be influenced by the speed at which glucose levels are dropping , as well as previous incidents . In newborns , *$%^ can produce irritability , jitters , myoclonic jerks , cyanosis , respiratory distress , apneic episodes , sweating , hypothermia , somnolence , hypotonia , refusal to feed , and seizures or `` spells . '' *$%^ can resemble asphyxia , hypocalcemia , sepsis , or heart failure . In both young and old patients , the brain may habituate to low glucose levels , with a reduction of noticeable symptoms despite neuroglycopenic impairment . In insulin-dependent diabetic patients this phenomenon is termed *$%^ unawareness and is a significant clinical problem when improved glycemic control is attempted . Another aspect of this phenomenon occurs in type I glycogenosis , when chronic *$%^ before diagnosis may be better tolerated than acute *$%^ after treatment is underway . Hypoglycemic symptoms can also occur when one is sleeping . Examples of symptoms during sleep can include damp bed sheets or clothes from perspiration . Having nightmares or the act of crying out can be a sign of *$%^ . Once the individual is awake they may feel tired , irritable , or confused and these may be signs of *$%^ as well . [ 8 ] In nearly all cases , *$%^ that is severe enough to cause seizures or unconsciousness can be reversed without obvious harm to the brain . Cases of death or permanent neurological damage occurring with a single episode have usually involved prolonged , untreated unconsciousness , interference with breathing , severe concurrent disease , or some other type of vulnerability . Nevertheless , brain damage or death has occasionally resulted from severe *$%^ . Research in healthy adults shows that mental efficiency declines slightly but measurably as blood glucose falls below 3.6 mM ( 65 mg/dL ) . Hormonal defense mechanisms ( adrenaline and glucagon ) are normally activated as it drops below a threshold level ( about 55 mg/dL ( 3.0 mM ) for most people ) , producing the typical hypoglycemic symptoms of shakiness and dysphoria . [ 9 ] :1589 Obvious impairment may not occur until the glucose falls below 40 mg/dL ( 2.2 mM ) , and many healthy people may occasionally have glucose levels below 65 in the morning without apparent effects . Since the brain effects of *$%^ , termed neuroglycopenia , determine whether a given low glucose is a `` problem '' for that person , most doctors use the term *$%^ only when a moderately low glucose level is accompanied by symptoms or brain effects . Determining the presence of both parts of this definition is not always straightforward , as hypoglycemic symptoms and effects are vague and can be produced by other conditions ; people with recurrently low glucose levels can lose their threshold symptoms so that severe neuroglycopenic impairment can occur without much warning , and many measurement methods ( especially glucose meters ) are imprecise at low levels . It may take longer to recover from severe *$%^ with unconsciousness or seizure even after restoration of normal blood glucose . When a person has not been unconscious , failure of carbohydrate to reverse the symptoms in 10\u201315 minutes increases the likelihood that *$%^ was not the cause of the symptoms . When severe *$%^ has persisted in a hospitalized person , the amount of glucose required to maintain satisfactory blood glucose levels becomes an important clue to the underlying etiology . Glucose requirements above 10 mg/kg/minute in infants , or 6 mg/kg/minute in children and adults are strong evidence for hyperinsulinism . In this context this is referred to as the glucose infusion rate ( GIR ) . Finally , the blood glucose response to glucagon given when the glucose is low can also help distinguish among various types of *$%^ . A rise of blood glucose by more than 30 mg/dl ( 1.70 mmol/l ) suggests insulin excess as the probable cause of the *$%^ . Significant *$%^ appears to increase the risk of cardiovascular disease . [ 10 ]", "Hypoglycemia"], ["The most common symptoms of IC/BPS are suprapubic pain , [ 8 ] urinary frequency , painful sexual intercourse , [ 9 ] and waking up from sleep to urinate . [ 10 ] In general , symptoms may include [ 11 ] painful urination described as a burning sensation in the urethra during urination , pelvic pain that is worsened with the consumption of certain foods or drinks , urinary urgency , and pressure in the bladder or pelvis . Other frequently described symptoms are urinary hesitancy ( needing to wait for the urinary stream to begin , often caused by pelvic floor dysfunction and tension ) , and discomfort and difficulty driving , working , or traveling . Pelvic pain experienced by those with IC typically worsens with filling of the urinary bladder and may improve with urination . During cystoscopy , 5\u201310 % of people with IC are found to have Hunner 's ulcers . [ 12 ] A person with IC may have discomfort only in the urethra , while another might struggle with pain in the entire pelvis . *$%^ *$%^ symptoms usually fall into one of two patterns : significant suprapubic pain with little frequency or a lesser amount of suprapubic pain but with increased urinary frequency . [ 13 ] Some people with IC/BPS have been diagnosed with other conditions such as irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , fibromyalgia , chronic fatigue syndrome , allergies , Sjogren 's syndrome , which raises the possibility that *$%^ *$%^ may be caused by mechanisms that cause these other conditions . [ 14 ] In addition , men with IC/PBS are frequently diagnosed as having chronic nonbacterial prostatitis , and there is an extensive overlap of symptoms and treatment between the two conditions , leading researchers to posit that the conditions may share the same etiology and pathology . [ 15 ]", "Interstitial cystitis"], ["Signs and symptoms which may suggest *$%^ *$%^ include : [ 1 ] Respiratory symptoms : coughing , coughing up blood , wheezing or shortness of breath Systemic symptoms : weight loss , fever , clubbing of the fingernails , or fatigue Symptoms due to the *$%^ mass pressing on adjacent structures : chest pain , bone pain , superior vena cava obstruction , difficulty swallowing If the *$%^ grows in the airways , it may obstruct airflow , causing breathing difficulties . The obstruction can lead to accumulation of secretions behind the blockage , and predispose to pneumonia . [ 1 ] Depending on the type of tumor , paraneoplastic phenomena\u2014symptoms not due to the local presence of cancer\u2014may initially attract attention to the disease . [ 12 ] In *$%^ *$%^ , these phenomena may include Lambert\u2013Eaton myasthenic syndrome ( muscle weakness due to autoantibodies ) , hypercalcemia , or syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone ( SIADH , abnormally concentrated urine and diluted blood ) . Tumors in the top of the *$%^ , known as Pancoast tumors , may invade the local part of the sympathetic nervous system , leading to Horner 's syndrome ( dropping of the eyelid and a small pupil on that side ) , as well as damage to the brachial plexus . [ 1 ] Many of the symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ ( poor appetite , weight loss , fever , fatigue ) are not specific . [ 8 ] In many people , the *$%^ has already spread beyond the original site by the time they have symptoms and seek medical attention . [ 13 ] Symptoms that suggest the presence of metastatic disease include weight loss , bone pain and neurological symptoms ( headaches , fainting , convulsions , or limb weakness ) . [ 1 ] Common sites of spread include the brain , bone , adrenal glands , opposite *$%^ , liver , pericardium , and kidneys . [ 13 ] About 10 % of people with *$%^ *$%^ do not have symptoms at diagnosis ; these cancers are incidentally found on routine chest radiography . [ 14 ]", "Lung cancer"], ["Symptoms may include a feeling of heaviness or fullness , edema , and ( occasionally ) aching pain in the affected area . In advanced *$%^ , there may be the presence of skin changes such as discoloration , verrucous ( wart-like ) hyperplasia , hyperkeratosis , and papillomatosis ; and eventually deformity ( elephantiasis ) . *$%^ should not be confused with edema arising from venous insufficiency , which is not *$%^ . However , untreated venous insufficiency can progress into a combined venous/lymphatic disorder which is treated the same way as *$%^ .

[ 3 ] The muscle weakness becomes progressively worse during periods of physical activity , and improves after periods of rest . Typically , the weakness and fatigue are worse towards the end of the day . [ 4 ] MG generally starts with ocular ( eye ) weakness ; it might then progress to a more severe generalized form , characterized by weakness in the extremities or while performing basic life functions . [ 5 ] In about two-thirds of individuals , the initial symptom of MG is related to the muscles around the eye . [ 3 ] There may be eyelid drooping ( ptosis due to weakness of levator palpebrae superioris ) [ 6 ] and double vision ( diplopia , [ 3 ] due to weakness of the extraocular muscles ) . [ 4 ] Eye symptoms tend to get worse when watching television , reading or driving , particularly in bright conditions . [ 3 ] Consequently , some affected individuals choose to wear sunglasses . [ 3 ] The term `` ocular *$%^ *$%^ '' describes a subtype of MG where muscle weakness is confined to the eyes , i.e . extraocular muscles , levator palpebrae superioris and orbicularis oculi . [ 6 ] Typically , this subtype evolves into generalized MG , usually after a few years . [ 6 ] Weakness of the muscles involved in swallowing may lead to swallowing difficulty ( dysphagia ) . Typically , this means that some food may be left in the mouth after an attempt to swallow , [ 7 ] or food and liquids may regurgitate into the nose rather than go down the throat ( velopharyngeal insufficiency ) . [ 4 ] Weakness of the muscles that move the jaw ( muscles of mastication ) may cause difficulty chewing . In individuals with MG , chewing tends to become more tiring when chewing tough , fibrous foods . [ 3 ] Difficulty in swallowing , chewing and speaking is the first symptom in about one-sixth of individuals . [ 3 ] Weakness of the muscles involved in speaking may lead to dysarthria and hypophonia . [ 3 ] Speech may be slow and slurred , [ 8 ] or have a nasal quality . [ 4 ] In some cases a singing hobby or profession must be abandoned . [ 7 ] Due to weakness of the muscles of facial expression and muscles of mastication , there may be facial weakness , manifesting as inability to hold the mouth closed [ 3 ] ( the `` hanging jaw sign '' ) , and a snarling appearance when attempting to smile . [ 4 ] Together with drooping eyelids , facial weakness may make the individual appear sleepy or sad . [ 3 ] There may be difficulty in holding the head upright . [ 8 ] The muscles that control breathing ( dyspnea ) and limb movements can also be affected , but rarely do these present as the first symptoms of MG , and they develop over months to years . [ 9 ] In a myasthenic crisis , a paralysis of the respiratory muscles occurs , necessitating assisted ventilation to sustain life . [ 10 ] Crises may be triggered by various biological stressors such as infection , fever , an adverse reaction to medication , or emotional stress . [ 10 ]", "Myasthenia gravis"], ["Migraines typically present with self-limited , recurrent severe headache associated with autonomic symptoms . [ 5 ] [ 10 ] About 15\u201330 % of people with migraines experience migraines with an aura [ 11 ] [ 9 ] and those who have migraines with aura also frequently have migraines without aura . [ 12 ] The severity of the pain , duration of the headache , and frequency of attacks is variable . [ 5 ] A *$%^ lasting longer than 72 hours is termed status migrainosus . [ 13 ] There are four possible phases to a *$%^ , although not all the phases are necessarily experienced : [ 3 ] The prodrome , which occurs hours or days before the headache The aura , which immediately precedes the headache The pain phase , also known as headache phase The postdrome , the effects experienced following the end of a *$%^ attack Prodromal or premonitory symptoms occur in about 60 % of those with migraines , [ 14 ] [ 15 ] with an onset that can range from two hours to two days before the start of pain or the aura . [ 16 ] These symptoms may include a wide variety of phenomena , [ 17 ] including altered mood , irritability , depression or euphoria , fatigue , craving for certain food ( s ) , stiff muscles ( especially in the neck ) , constipation or diarrhea , and sensitivity to smells or noise . [ 14 ] This may occur in those with either *$%^ with aura or *$%^ without aura . [ 18 ] An aura is a transient focal neurological phenomenon that occurs before or during the headache . [ 15 ] Auras appear gradually over a number of minutes and generally last less than 60 minutes . [ 19 ] Symptoms can be visual , sensory or motor in nature and many people experience more than one . [ 20 ] Visual effects occur most frequently ; they occur in up to 99 % of cases and in more than 50 % of cases are not accompanied by sensory or motor effects . [ 20 ] Vision disturbances often consist of a scintillating scotoma ( an area of partial alteration in the field of vision which flickers and may interfere with a person 's ability to read or drive ) . [ 15 ] These typically start near the center of vision and then spread out to the sides with zigzagging lines which have been described as looking like fortifications or walls of a castle . [ 20 ] Usually the lines are in black and white but some people also see colored lines . [ 20 ] Some people lose part of their field of vision known as hemianopsia while others experience blurring . [ 20 ] Sensory aurae are the second most common type ; they occur in 30\u201340 % of people with auras . [ 20 ] Often a feeling of pins-and-needles begins on one side in the hand and arm and spreads to the nose\u2013mouth area on the same side . [ 20 ] Numbness usually occurs after the tingling has passed with a loss of position sense . [ 20 ] Other symptoms of the aura phase can include speech or language disturbances , world spinning , and less commonly motor problems . [ 20 ] Motor symptoms indicate that this is a hemiplegic *$%^ , and weakness often lasts longer than one hour unlike other auras . [ 20 ] Auditory hallucinations or delusions have also been described . [ 21 ] Classically the headache is unilateral , throbbing , and moderate to severe in intensity . [ 19 ] It usually comes on gradually [ 19 ] and is aggravated by physical activity . [ 3 ] In more than 40 % of cases , however , the pain may be bilateral and neck pain is commonly associated with it . [ 22 ] Bilateral pain is particularly common in those who have migraines without an aura . [ 15 ] Less commonly pain may occur primarily in the back or top of the head . [ 15 ] The pain usually lasts 4 to 72 hours in adults , [ 19 ] however in young children frequently lasts less than 1 hour . [ 23 ] The frequency of attacks is variable , from a few in a lifetime to several a week , with the average being about one a month . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The pain is frequently accompanied by nausea , vomiting , sensitivity to light , sensitivity to sound , sensitivity to smells , fatigue and irritability . [ 15 ] In a basilar *$%^ , a *$%^ with neurological symptoms related to the brain stem or with neurological symptoms on both sides of the body , [ 26 ] common effects include a sense of the world spinning , light-headedness , and confusion . [ 15 ] Nausea occurs in almost 90 % of people , and vomiting occurs in about one-third . [ 27 ] Many thus seek a dark and quiet room . [ 27 ] Other symptoms may include blurred vision , nasal stuffiness , diarrhea , frequent urination , pallor , or sweating . [ 28 ] Swelling or tenderness of the scalp may occur as can neck stiffness . [ 28 ] Associated symptoms are less common in the elderly . [ 29 ] Rarely , an aura occurs without a subsequent headache . [ 20 ] This is known as an acephalgic *$%^ or silent *$%^ ; however , it is difficult to assess the frequency of such cases because people who do not experience symptoms severe enough to seek treatment may not realize that anything unusual is happening to them and pass it off without reporting any problems . The effects of *$%^ may persist for some days after the main headache has ended ; this is called the *$%^ postdrome . Many report a sore feeling in the area where the *$%^ was , and some report impaired thinking for a few days after the headache has passed . The patient may feel tired or `` hung over '' and have head pain , cognitive difficulties , gastrointestinal symptoms , mood changes , and weakness . [ 30 ] According to one summary , `` Some people feel unusually refreshed or euphoric after an attack , whereas others note depression and malaise . `` [ 31 ] For some individuals this can vary each time .", "Migraine"], ["*$%^ itself has no symptoms ; its main consequence is the increased risk of bone fractures . Osteoporotic fractures occur in situations where healthy people would not normally break a bone ; they are therefore regarded as fragility fractures . Typical fragility fractures occur in the vertebral column , rib , hip and wrist . Fractures are the most dangerous aspect of *$%^ . Debilitating acute and chronic pain in the elderly is often attributed to fractures from *$%^ and can lead to further disability and early mortality . [ 14 ] These fractures may also be asymptomatic . The most common osteoporotic fractures are of the wrist , spine , shoulder and hip . The symptoms of a vertebral collapse ( `` compression fracture '' ) are sudden back pain , often with radicular pain ( shooting pain due to nerve root compression ) and rarely with spinal cord compression or cauda equina syndrome . Multiple vertebral fractures lead to a stooped posture , loss of height , and chronic pain with resultant reduction in mobility . [ 15 ] Fractures of the long bones acutely impair mobility and may require surgery . Hip fracture , in particular , usually requires prompt surgery , as serious risks are associated with it , such as deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism , and increased mortality . Fracture risk calculators assess the risk of fracture based upon several criteria , including BMD , age , smoking , alcohol usage , weight , and gender . Recognized calculators include FRAX [ 16 ] and Dubbo . The term `` established *$%^ '' is used when a broken bone due to *$%^ has occurred . [ 17 ] *$%^ is a part of frailty syndrome . The increased risk of falling associated with aging leads to fractures of the wrist , spine , and hip . The risk of falling , in turn , is increased by impaired eyesight due to any cause ( e.g . glaucoma , macular degeneration ) , balance disorder , movement disorders ( e.g . Parkinson 's disease ) , dementia , and sarcopenia ( age-related loss of skeletal muscle ) . Collapse ( transient loss of postural tone with or without loss of consciousness ) leads to a significant risk of falls ; causes of syncope are manifold , but may include cardiac arrhythmias ( irregular heart beat ) , vasovagal syncope , orthostatic hypotension ( abnormal drop in blood pressure on standing up ) , and seizures . Removal of obstacles and loose carpets in the living environment may substantially reduce falls . Those with previous falls , as well as those with gait or balance disorders , are most at risk . [ 18 ]", "Osteoporosis"], ["PKU is commonly included in the newborn screening panel of most countries , with varied detection techniques . Most babies in developed countries are screened for PKU soon after birth . [ 5 ] Screening for PKU is done with bacterial inhibition assay ( Guthrie test ) , immunoassays using fluorometric or photometric detection , or amino acid measurement using tandem mass spectrometry ( MS/MS ) . Measurements done using MS/MS determine the concentration of Phe and the ratio of Phe to tyrosine , the ratio will be elevated in PKU . [ 6 ] Because the mother 's body is able to break down phenylalanine during pregnancy , infants with PKU are normal at birth . The disease is not detectable by physical examination at that time , because no damage has yet been done . However , a blood test can reveal elevated phenylalanine levels after one or two days of normal infant feeding . This is the purpose of newborn screening , to detect the disease with a blood test before any damage is done , so that treatment can prevent the damage from happening . If a child is not diagnosed during the routine newborn screening test ( typically performed 2\u20137 days after birth , using samples drawn by neonatal heel prick ) , and a phenylalanine restricted diet is not introduced , then phenylalanine levels in the blood will increase over time . Toxic levels of phenylalanine ( and insufficient levels of tyrosine ) can interfere with infant development in ways which have permanent effects . The disease may present clinically with seizures , hypopigmentation ( excessively fair hair and skin ) , and a `` musty odor '' to the baby 's sweat and urine ( due to phenylacetate , a carboxylic acid produced by the oxidation of phenylketone ) . In most cases , a repeat test should be done at approximately two weeks of age to verify the initial test and uncover any *$%^ that was initially missed . Untreated children often fail to attain early developmental milestones , develop microcephaly , and demonstrate progressive impairment of cerebral function . Hyperactivity , EEG abnormalities , and seizures , and severe learning disabilities are major clinical problems later in life . The characteristic `` musty or mousy '' odor of skin as well as a tendency towards and eczema , also persist throughout life without treatment . The damage done to the brain if PKU is untreated during the first months of life is not reversible . It is critical to control the diet of infants with PKU very carefully so that brain has an opportunity to develop normally . Affected children who are detected at birth and treated are much less likely to develop neurological problems or have seizures and intellectual disability ( though such clinical disorders are still possible . ) In general , however , outcomes for people treated for PKU are good . Treated people may have no detectable physical , neurological , or developmental problems at all . Many adults with PKU who were diagnosed through newborn screening and have been treated since birth have high educational achievement , successful careers , and fulfilling family lives . [ 7 ] [ 8 ]", "Phenylketonuria"], ["The term `` *$%^ '' is used to identify the disease caused by any of the three serotypes of poliovirus . Two basic patterns of polio infection are described : a minor illness which does not involve the central nervous system ( CNS ) , sometimes called abortive *$%^ , and a major illness involving the CNS , which may be paralytic or nonparalytic . [ 12 ] In most people with a normal immune system , a poliovirus infection is asymptomatic . Rarely , the infection produces minor symptoms ; these may include upper respiratory tract infection ( sore throat and fever ) , gastrointestinal disturbances ( nausea , vomiting , abdominal pain , constipation or , rarely , diarrhea ) , and influenza-like illness . [ 1 ] The virus enters the central nervous system in about 1 % of infections . Most patients with CNS involvement develop nonparalytic aseptic meningitis , with symptoms of headache , neck , back , abdominal and extremity pain , fever , vomiting , lethargy , and irritability . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] About one to five in 1000 cases progress to paralytic disease , in which the muscles become weak , floppy and poorly controlled , and , finally , completely paralyzed ; this condition is known as acute flaccid paralysis . [ 15 ] Depending on the site of paralysis , paralytic *$%^ is classified as spinal , bulbar , or bulbospinal . Encephalitis , an infection of the brain tissue itself , can occur in rare cases , and is usually restricted to infants . It is characterized by confusion , changes in mental status , headaches , fever , and , less commonly , seizures and spastic paralysis . [ 16 ]", "Poliomyelitis"], ["RA primarily affects joints , however it also affects other organs in more than 15\u201325 % of individuals . [ 10 ] *$%^ of joints involves inflammation of the synovial membrane . Joints become swollen , tender and warm , and stiffness limits their movement . With time , multiple joints are affected ( it is a polyarthritis ) . Most commonly involved are the small joints of the hands , feet and cervical spine , but larger joints like the shoulder and knee can also be involved . [ 11 ] :1089 Synovitis can lead to tethering of tissue with loss of movement and erosion of the joint surface causing deformity and loss of function . [ 2 ] RA typically manifests with signs of inflammation , with the affected joints being swollen , warm , painful and stiff , particularly early in the morning on waking or following prolonged inactivity . Increased stiffness early in the morning is often a prominent feature of the disease and typically lasts for more than an hour . Gentle movements may relieve symptoms in early stages of the disease . These signs help distinguish *$%^ from non-inflammatory problems of the joints , often referred to as osteoarthritis . In *$%^ of non-inflammatory causes , signs of inflammation and early morning stiffness are less prominent with stiffness typically less than one hour , and movements induce pain caused by mechanical *$%^ . [ 12 ] The pain associated with RA is induced at the site of inflammation and classified as nociceptive as opposed to neuropathic . [ 13 ] The joints are often affected in a fairly symmetrical fashion , although this is not specific , and the initial presentation may be asymmetrical . [ 11 ] :1089 As the pathology progresses the inflammatory activity leads to tendon tethering and erosion and destruction of the joint surface , which impairs range of movement and leads to deformity . The fingers may suffer from almost any deformity depending on which joints are most involved . Specific deformities , which also occur in osteoarthritis , include ulnar deviation , boutonniere deformity , swan neck deformity and `` Z-thumb . '' `` Z-thumb '' or `` Z-deformity '' consists of hyperextension of the interphalangeal joint , fixed flexion and subluxation of the metacarpophalangeal joint and gives a `` Z '' appearance to the thumb . [ 11 ] :1089 The hammer toe deformity may be seen . In the worst case , joints are known as *$%^ mutilans due to the mutilating nature of the deformities . [ 14 ] The *$%^ nodule , which is sometimes in the skin , is the most common non joint feature . [ 15 ] They occur in 30 % of people . [ 15 ] It is a type of inflammatory reaction known to pathologists as a `` necrotizing granuloma '' . The initial pathologic process in nodule formation is unknown but may be essentially the same as the synovitis , since similar structural features occur in both . The nodule has a central area of fibrinoid necrosis that may be fissured and which corresponds to the fibrin-rich necrotic material found in and around an affected synovial space . Surrounding the necrosis is a layer of palisading macrophages and fibroblasts , corresponding to the intimal layer in synovium and a cuff of connective tissue containing clusters of lymphocytes and plasma cells , corresponding to the subintimal zone in synovitis . The typical *$%^ nodule may be a few millimetres to a few centimetres in diameter and is usually found over bony prominences , such as the elbow , the heel , the knuckles , or other areas that sustain repeated mechanical stress . Nodules are associated with a positive RF ( *$%^ factor ) titer and severe erosive *$%^ . Rarely , these can occur in internal organs or at diverse sites on the body . [ citation needed ] . Several forms of vasculitis occur in RA . A benign form occurs as microinfarcts around the nailfolds . More severe forms include livedo reticularis , which is a network ( reticulum ) of erythematous to purplish discoloration of the skin caused by the presence of an obliterative cutaneous capillaropathy . [ citation needed ] . Other , rather rare , skin associated symptoms include pyoderma gangrenosum , Sweet 's syndrome , drug reactions , erythema nodosum , lobe panniculitis , atrophy of finger skin , palmar erythema , diffuse thinning ( rice paper skin ) , and skin fragility ( often worsened by corticosteroid use ) . [ citation needed ] . Fibrosis of the lungs is a recognized response to *$%^ disease . It is also a rare but well recognized consequence of therapy ( for example with methotrexate and leflunomide ) . Caplan 's syndrome describes lung nodules in individuals with RA and additional exposure to coal dust . Pleural effusions are also associated with RA . Another complication of RA is *$%^ Lung Disease . It is estimated that about one quarter of Americans with RA develop *$%^ Lung Disease . [ 16 ] Renal amyloidosis can occur as a consequence of chronic inflammation . [ 17 ] RA may affect the kidney glomerulus directly through a vasculopathy or a mesangial infiltrate but this is less well documented ( though this is not surprising , considering immune complex-mediated hypersensitivities are known for pathogenic deposition of immune complexes in organs where blood is filtered at high pressure to form other fluids , such as urine and synovial fluid [ 18 ] ) . Treatment with penicillamine and gold salts are recognized causes of membranous nephropathy . People with RA are more prone to atherosclerosis , and risk of myocardial infarction ( heart attack ) and stroke is markedly increased . [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Other possible complications that may arise include : pericarditis , endocarditis , left ventricular failure , valvulitis and fibrosis . [ 21 ] Many people with RA do not experience the same chest pain that others feel when they have angina or myocardial infarction . To reduce cardiovascular risk , it is crucial to maintain optimal control of the inflammation caused by RA ( which may be involved in causing the cardiovascular risk ) , and to use exercise and medications appropriately to reduce other cardiovascular risk factors such as blood lipids and blood pressure . Doctors who treat people with RA should be sensitive to cardiovascular risk when prescribing anti-inflammatory medications , and may want to consider prescribing routine use of low doses of aspirin if the gastrointestinal effects are tolerable . [ 21 ]", "Rheumatoid arthritis"], ["The incubation period between contraction and the first obvious symptoms of the disease is around 12 days . Once inhaled , variola major virus invades the oropharyngeal ( mouth and throat ) or the respiratory mucosa , migrates to regional lymph nodes , and begins to multiply . In the initial growth phase the virus seems to move from cell to cell , but around the 12th day , lysis of many infected cells occurs and the virus is found in the bloodstream in large numbers ( this is called viremia ) , and a second wave of multiplication occurs in the spleen , bone marrow , and lymph nodes . The initial or prodromal symptoms are similar to other viral diseases such as influenza and the common cold : fever of at least 38.3 \u00b0C ( 101 \u00b0F ) , muscle pain , malaise , headache and prostration . As the digestive tract is commonly involved , nausea and vomiting and backache often occur . The prodrome , or preeruptive stage , usually lasts 2\u20134 days . By days 12\u201315 the first visible lesions\u2014small reddish spots called enanthem\u2014appear on mucous membranes of the mouth , tongue , palate , and throat , and temperature falls to near normal . These lesions rapidly enlarge and rupture , releasing large amounts of virus into the saliva . [ 7 ] *$%^ virus preferentially attacks skin cells , causing the characteristic pimples ( called macules ) associated with the disease . A rash develops on the skin 24 to 48 hours after lesions on the mucous membranes appear . Typically the macules first appear on the forehead , then rapidly spread to the whole face , proximal portions of extremities , the trunk , and lastly to distal portions of extremities . The process takes no more than 24 to 36 hours , after which no new lesions appear . [ 7 ] At this point variola major infection can take several very different courses , resulting in four types of *$%^ disease based on the Rao classification : [ 21 ] ordinary , modified , malignant ( or flat ) , and hemorrhagic . Historically , *$%^ has an overall fatality rate of about 30 percent ; however , the malignant and hemorrhagic forms are usually fatal . [ 22 ] Ninety percent or more of *$%^ cases among unvaccinated persons are of the ordinary type . [ 20 ] In this form of the disease , by the second day of the rash the macules become raised papules . By the third or fourth day the papules fill with an opalescent fluid to become vesicles . This fluid becomes opaque and turbid within 24\u201348 hours , giving them the appearance of pustules ; however , the so-called pustules are filled with tissue debris , not pus . [ 7 ] By the sixth or seventh day , all the skin lesions have become pustules . Between seven and ten days the pustules mature and reach their maximum size . The pustules are sharply raised , typically round , tense , and firm to the touch . The pustules are deeply embedded in the dermis , giving them the feel of a small bead in the skin . Fluid slowly leaks from the pustules , and by the end of the second week the pustules deflate , and start to dry up , forming crusts ( or scabs ) . By day 16\u201320 scabs have formed over all the lesions , which have started to flake off , leaving depigmented scars . [ 23 ] Ordinary *$%^ generally produces a discrete rash , in which the pustules stand out on the skin separately . The distribution of the rash is densest on the face ; denser on the extremities than on the trunk ; and on the extremities , denser on the distal parts than on the proximal . The palms of the hands and soles of the feet are involved in the majority of cases . Sometimes , the blisters merge into sheets , forming a confluent rash , which begin to detach the outer layers of skin from the underlying flesh . Patients with confluent *$%^ often remain ill even after scabs have formed over all the lesions . In one case series , the case-fatality rate in confluent *$%^ was 62 percent . [ 20 ] Referring to the character of the eruption and the rapidity of its development , modified *$%^ occurs mostly in previously vaccinated people . In this form the prodromal illness still occurs but may be less severe than in the ordinary type . There is usually no fever during evolution of the rash . The skin lesions tend to be fewer and evolve more quickly , are more superficial , and may not show the uniform characteristic of more typical *$%^ . [ 23 ] Modified *$%^ is rarely , if ever , fatal . This form of variola major is more easily confused with chickenpox . [ 20 ] In malignant-type *$%^ ( also called flat *$%^ ) the lesions remain almost flush with the skin at the time when raised vesicles form in the ordinary type . It is unknown why some people develop this type . Historically , it accounted for 5\u201310 percent of cases , and the majority ( 72 percent ) were children . [ 24 ] Malignant *$%^ is accompanied by a severe prodromal phase that lasts 3\u20134 days , prolonged high fever , and severe symptoms of toxemia . The rash on the tongue and palate is extensive . Skin lesions mature slowly and by the seventh or eighth day they are flat and appear to be buried in the skin . Unlike ordinary-type *$%^ , the vesicles contain little fluid , are soft and velvety to the touch , and may contain hemorrhages . Malignant *$%^ is nearly always fatal . [ 20 ] Hemorrhagic *$%^ is a severe form that is accompanied by extensive bleeding into the skin , mucous membranes , and gastrointestinal tract . This form develops in approximately 2 percent of infections and occurred mostly in adults . [ 20 ] In hemorrhagic *$%^ the skin does not blister , but remains smooth . Instead , bleeding occurs under the skin , making it look charred and black , [ 20 ] hence this form of the disease is also known as black pox . [ 25 ] In the early , or fulminating form , hemorrhaging appears on the second or third day as sub-conjunctival bleeding turns the whites of the eyes deep red . Hemorrhagic *$%^ also produces a dusky erythema , petechiae , and hemorrhages in the spleen , kidney , serosa , muscle , and , rarely , the epicardium , liver , testes , ovaries and bladder . Death often occurs suddenly between the fifth and seventh days of illness , when only a few insignificant skin lesions are present . A later form of the disease occurs in patients who survive for 8\u201310 days . The hemorrhages appear in the early eruptive period , and the rash is flat and does not progress beyond the vesicular stage . [ 20 ] Patients in the early stage of disease show a decrease in coagulation factors ( e.g . platelets , prothrombin , and globulin ) and an increase in circulating antithrombin . Patients in the late stage have significant thrombocytopenia ; however , deficiency of coagulation factors is less severe . Some in the late stage also show increased antithrombin . [ 7 ] This form of *$%^ occurs in anywhere from 3 to 25 percent of fatal cases depending on the virulence of the *$%^ strain . [ 22 ] Hemorrhagic *$%^ is usually fatal . [ 20 ]", "Smallpox"], ["The characteristic symptoms of a *$%^ infection include intense itching and superficial burrows . [ 12 ] The burrow tracks are often linear , to the point that a neat `` line '' of four or more closely placed and equally developed mosquito-like `` bites '' is almost diagnostic of the disease . Because the host develops the symptoms as a reaction to the mites ' presence over time , there is typically a delay of four to six weeks between the onset of infestation and the onset of itching . Similarly , symptoms often persist for one to several weeks after successful eradication of the mites . As noted , those re-exposed to *$%^ after successful treatment may exhibit symptoms of the new infestation in a much shorter period\u2014as little as one to four days . [ 13 ] In the classic scenario , the itch is made worse by warmth , and is usually experienced as being worse at night , possibly because there are fewer distractions . [ 12 ] As a symptom , it is less common in the elderly . [ 12 ] The superficial burrows of *$%^ usually occur in the area of the finger webs , feet , ventral wrists , elbows , back , buttocks , and external genitals . [ 12 ] Except in infants and the immunosuppressed , infection generally does not occur in the skin of the face or scalp . The burrows are created by excavation of the adult mite in the epidermis . [ 12 ] In most people , the trails of the burrowing mites are linear or s-shaped tracks in the skin often accompanied by rows of small , pimple-like mosquito or insect bites . These signs are often found in crevices of the body , such as on the webs of fingers and toes , around the genital area , in stomach folds of the skin , and under the breasts of women . [ 15 ] Symptoms typically appear two to six weeks after infestation for individuals never before exposed to *$%^ . For those having been previously exposed , the symptoms can appear within several days after infestation . However , it is not unknown for symptoms to appear after several months or years . [ 16 ] Acropustulosis , or blisters and pustules on the palms and soles of the feet , are characteristic symptoms of *$%^ in infants . [ 15 ] *$%^ of the foot *$%^ of the foot *$%^ of the arm *$%^ of the arm *$%^ of the hand *$%^ of the hand *$%^ of the finger *$%^ of the finger The elderly and people with an impaired immune system , such as HIV , cancer , or those on immunosuppressive medications , are susceptible to crusted *$%^ ( formerly called Norwegian *$%^ ) . [ 12 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] On those with weaker immune systems , the host becomes a more fertile breeding ground for the mites , which spread over the host 's body , except the face . Sufferers of crusted *$%^ exhibit scaly rashes , slight itching , and thick crusts of skin that contain thousands of mites . [ 18 ] Such areas make eradication of mites particularly difficult , as the crusts protect the mites from topical miticides/scabicides , necessitating prolonged treatment of these areas .", "Scabies"], ["*$%^ causes a wide variety of neuropathic symptoms due to damage of the spinal cord . Patients may experience severe chronic pain , abnormal sensations and loss of sensation particularly in the hands . Some patients experience paralysis or paresis temporarily or permanently . A syrinx may also cause disruptions in the parasympathetic and sympathetic nervous systems , leading to abnormal body temperature or sweating , bowel control issues , or other problems . If the syrinx is higher up in the spinal cord or affecting the brainstem as in syringobulbia , vocal cord paralysis , ipsilateral tongue wasting , trigeminal nerve sensory loss , and other signs may occur . [ 3 ] Rarely , bladder stones can occur in the onset of weakness in the lower extremities . [ 4 ] Classically , *$%^ spares the dorsal column/medial lemniscus of the spinal cord , leaving pressure , vibration , touch and proprioception intact in the upper extremities . Neuropathic arthropathy , also known as a Charcot joint , can occur , particularly in the shoulders , in patients with *$%^ . The loss of sensory fibers to the joint is theorized to lead to damage of the joint over time . [ 5 ]", "Syringomyelia"], ["Classically , the course of untreated *$%^ *$%^ is divided into four distinct stages , each lasting about a week . Over the course of these stages , the patient becomes exhausted and emaciated . [ 13 ] In the first week , the body temperature rises slowly , and *$%^ fluctuations are seen with relative bradycardia ( Faget sign ) , malaise , headache , and cough . A bloody nose ( epistaxis ) is seen in a quarter of cases , and abdominal pain is also possible . A decrease in the number of circulating white blood cells ( leukopenia ) occurs with eosinopenia and relative lymphocytosis ; blood cultures are positive for Salmonella typhi or S. paratyphi . The Widal test is negative in the first week . [ citation needed ] In the second week , the person is often too tired to get up , with high *$%^ in plateau around 40 \u00b0C ( 104 \u00b0F ) and bradycardia ( sphygmothermic dissociation or Faget sign ) , classically with a dicrotic pulse wave . Delirium is frequent , often calm , but sometimes agitated . This delirium gives to *$%^ the nickname of `` nervous *$%^ '' . Rose spots appear on the lower chest and abdomen in around a third of patients . Rhonchi are heard in lung bases . In the third week of *$%^ *$%^ , a number of complications can occur : Intestinal haemorrhage due to bleeding in congested Peyer 's patches ; this can be very serious , but is usually not fatal . Intestinal perforation in the distal ileum : this is a very serious complication and is frequently fatal . It may occur without alarming symptoms until septicaemia or diffuse peritonitis sets in . Encephalitis Respiratory diseases such as pneumonia and acute bronchitis Neuropsychiatric symptoms ( described as `` muttering delirium '' or `` coma vigil '' ) , with picking at bedclothes or imaginary objects . Metastatic abscesses , cholecystitis , endocarditis , and osteitis The *$%^ is still very high and oscillates very little over 24 hours . Dehydration ensues , and the patient is delirious ( *$%^ state ) . One-third of affected individuals develop a macular rash on the trunk . Platelet count goes down slowly and risk of bleeding rises .

By the end of third week , the *$%^ starts subsiding ( defervescence ) . This carries on into the fourth and final week .", "Typhoid fever"], ["Pain is the most notable symptom of *$%^ , and can be characterized as a burning , stinging , irritation or sharp pain that occurs in the vulva and entrance to the vagina . It may be constant , intermittent or happen only when the vulva is touched , but *$%^ is usually defined as lasting for years . Symptoms may occur in one place or the entire vulvar area . It can occur during or after sexual activity , when tampons are inserted , or when prolonged pressure is applied to the vulva , such as during sitting , bike riding , or horseback riding . [ 3 ] Some cases of *$%^ are idiopathic where no particular cause can be determined . Like many other people with pain disorders , those with *$%^ may often be impacted by the frustration of finding a diagnosis , subsequently confronted with an area of medicine that is still in relative infancy . The cause is still unknown and treatment success varies . Therefore , many become frustrated and sometimes depressed with a lower quality of life . Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome ( VVS ) , vestibulodynia , or simply vulvar vestibulitis or `` localized ( to the vestibule ) provoked *$%^ '' [ 4 ] refers to pain localized to the vestibular region . It tends to be associated with a highly localized `` burning '' or `` cutting '' type of pain . The pain of *$%^ may extend into the clitoris ; this is referred to as clitorodynia . Vulvar vestibulitis syndrome is the most common subtype of *$%^ that affects premenopausal women \u2013 the syndrome has been cited as affecting about 10 % \u201315 % of women seeking gynecological care . [ 5 ] [ 6 ]", "Vulvodynia"], ["*$%^ has many possible manifestations . These signs and symptoms may be either as a direct result of the failure of liver cells or secondary to the resultant portal hypertension . There are also some manifestations whose causes are nonspecific , but may occur in *$%^ . Likewise , the absence of any does not rule ; out the possibility of *$%^ . [ 7 ] *$%^ of the liver is slow and gradual in its development . It is usually well advanced before its symptoms are noticeable enough to cause alarm . Weakness and loss of weight may be early symptoms . The following features are as a direct consequence of liver cells not functioning . Spider angiomata or spider nevi are vascular lesions consisting of a central arteriole surrounded by many smaller vessels ( hence the name `` spider '' ) and occur due to an increase in estradiol . One study found that spider angiomata occur in about 1/3 of cases . [ 8 ] Palmar erythema is a reddening of palms at the thenar and hypothenar eminences also as a result of increased estrogen . [ 9 ] Gynecomastia , or increase in breast gland size in men that is not cancerous , is caused by increased estradiol and can occur in up to 2/3 of patients . [ 10 ] This is different from increase in breast fat in overweight people . [ 11 ] Hypogonadism , a decrease in sex hormones manifest as impotence , infertility , loss of sexual drive , and testicular atrophy , can result from primary gonadal injury or suppression of hypothalamic/pituitary function . Hypogonadism is associated with *$%^ due to alcoholism and hemochromatosis . [ 12 ] Liver size can be enlarged , normal , or shrunken in people with *$%^ . Ascites , accumulation of fluid in the peritoneal cavity ( space in the abdomen ) , gives rise to flank dullness ( needs about 1500 ml to detect flank dullness ) . This may be visible as increase in abdominal girth . [ 13 ] Fetor hepaticus is a musty breath odor resulting from increased dimethyl sulfide . [ 14 ] Jaundice is yellow discoloration of the skin and mucous membranes ( with the eye being especially noticeable ) due to increased bilirubin ( at least 2\u20133 mg/dL or 30 \u00b5mol/L ) . Urine may also appear dark . [ 13 ] Liver *$%^ increases resistance to blood flow and higher pressure in the portal venous system , resulting in portal hypertension . Effects of portal hypertension include : Splenomegaly ( increase in size of the spleen ) is found in 35 % to 50 % of patients . [ 7 ] Esophageal varices result from collateral portal blood flow through vessels in the stomach and esophagus ( a process called Portacaval anastomosis ) . When these blood vessels become enlarged , they are called varices and are more likely to burst . [ 13 ] Caput medusa are dilated periumbilical collateral veins due to portal hypertension . Blood from the portal venous system may be shunted through the periumbilical veins and ultimately to the abdominal wall veins , manifesting as a pattern that may resemble the head of Medusa . [ 13 ] Cruveilhier-Baumgarten murmur is a venous hum heard in the epigastric region ( on examination by stethoscope ) due to collateral connections forming between portal system and the periumbilical veins as a result of portal hypertension . There are some changes seen in *$%^ whose causes are not clearly known . They may also be a sign of other non-liver related causes . Nail changes . Muehrcke 's lines - paired horizontal bands separated by normal color resulting from hypoalbuminemia ( inadequate production of albumin ) . It is not specific for *$%^ . [ 15 ] Terry 's nails ( double nails ) - proximal two-thirds of the nail plate appears white with distal one-third red , also due to hypoalbuminemia [ 16 ] Clubbing - angle between the nail plate and proximal nail fold > 180 degrees . It is not specific for *$%^ and can therefore happen in a number of conditions [ 16 ] Muehrcke 's lines - paired horizontal bands separated by normal color resulting from hypoalbuminemia ( inadequate production of albumin ) . It is not specific for *$%^ . [ 15 ] Terry 's nails ( double nails ) - proximal two-thirds of the nail plate appears white with distal one-third red , also due to hypoalbuminemia [ 16 ] Clubbing - angle between the nail plate and proximal nail fold > 180 degrees . It is not specific for *$%^ and can therefore happen in a number of conditions [ 16 ] Hypertrophic osteoarthropathy . Chronic proliferative periostitis of the long bones that can cause considerable pain . It is not specific for *$%^ . [ 16 ] Dupuytren 's contracture . Thickening and shortening of palmar fascia ( tissue on the palm of the hands ) that leads to flexion deformities of the fingers . Caused by fibroblastic proliferation ( increased growth ) and disorderly collagen deposition . It is relatively common ( 33 % of patients ) . [ 16 ] Other . Weakness , fatigue , anorexia , weight loss . [ 13 ] As the disease progresses , complications may develop . In some people , these may be the first signs of the disease . Bruising and bleeding resulting from decreased production of coagulation factors . Hepatic encephalopathy - the liver does not clear ammonia and related nitrogenous substances from the blood , which are carried to the brain , affecting cerebral functioning : neglect of personal appearance , unresponsiveness , forgetfulness , trouble concentrating , or changes in sleep habits . This can be seen on exam by asterixis which is bilateral asynchronous flapping of outstretched , dorsiflexed hands seen in patients with hepatic encephalopathy . [ 13 ] Sensitivity to medication caused by decreased metabolism of the active compounds . Acute kidney injury ( particularly hepatorenal syndrome ) [ 17 ]", "Cirrhosis"], ["Signs and symptoms of a *$%^ *$%^ mainly depend on the size of the *$%^ and its location . The time of symptom onset depends in many cases on whether the *$%^ is benign or malignant , and in many cases is also related to the change in the nature of the neoplasm , from slow-growing , late-symptom-onset benign to faster-growing , early-symptom-onset malignant . Symptoms of both primary and secondary *$%^ tumors can be divided into three main categories : Symptoms as consequences of increased intracranial pressure ( often first noticed ) : Large tumors or tumors with extensive peritumoral swelling ( edema ) inevitably lead to elevated intracranial pressure which translates clinically into headaches , vomiting with or without nausea , altered state of consciousness ( somnolence , coma ) , dilation of the pupil on the side of the lesion ( anisocoria ) , papilledema ( prominent optic disc at the funduscopic eye examination ) . However , even small tumors obstructing the passage of cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) can also present such symptoms . Increased intracranial pressure may result in *$%^ herniation ( i.e . displacement ) of certain parts of the *$%^ , such as the cerebellar tonsils or the temporal uncus , resulting in lethal brainstem compression . In very young children , elevated intracranial pressure may cause an increase in the diameter of the skull and bulging of the fontanelles . Dysfunction : depending on the *$%^ location and the damage it may have caused to surrounding *$%^ structures , either through compression or infiltration , focal neurologic symptoms may occur , such as cognitive and behavioral impairment including impaired judgment , memory loss , lack of recognition , spatial orientation disorders , personality or emotional changes , hemiparesis , hypoesthesia , aphasia , ataxia , visual field impairment , impaired sense of smell , impaired hearing , facial paralysis , double vision , dizziness , but more severe symptoms might occur too , such as paralysis on one side of the body hemiplegia or impairment in swallowing . These symptoms are not specific for *$%^ tumors \u2013 they may be caused by a large variety of neurologic conditions ( e.g . stroke , traumatic *$%^ injury ) . What counts , however , is the location of the lesion and the functional systems ( e.g . motor , sensory , visual , etc . ) it affects . A bilateral temporal visual field defect ( bitemporal hemianopia\u2014due to compression of the optic chiasm ) , often associated with endocrine dysfunction\u2014either hypopituitarism or hyperproduction of pituitary hormones and hyperprolactinemia is suggestive of a pituitary *$%^ . Irritation : abnormal fatigue , weariness , absences and tremors , but also epileptic seizures . A benign *$%^ *$%^ may be present for some years and be asymptomatic . Others might present ambiguous and intermittent symptoms like headaches and vomiting or weariness and so be mistaken for gastrointestinal disorders . In these cases secondary symptoms need to be looked into .", "Brain tumor"], ["In adults , the most common symptom of *$%^ is a severe headache , occurring in almost 90 % of cases of bacterial *$%^ , followed by nuchal rigidity ( the inability to flex the neck forward passively due to increased neck muscle tone and stiffness ) . [ 7 ] The classic triad of diagnostic signs consists of nuchal rigidity , sudden high fever , and altered mental status ; however , all three features are present in only 44\u201346 % of bacterial *$%^ cases . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] If none of the three signs are present , acute *$%^ is extremely unlikely . [ 8 ] Other signs commonly associated with *$%^ include photophobia ( intolerance to bright light ) and phonophobia ( intolerance to loud noises ) . Small children often do not exhibit the aforementioned symptoms , and may only be irritable and look unwell . [ 2 ] The fontanelle ( the soft spot on the top of a baby 's head ) can bulge in infants aged up to 6 months . Other features that distinguish *$%^ from less severe illnesses in young children are leg pain , cold extremities , and an abnormal skin color . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Nuchal rigidity occurs in 70 % of bacterial *$%^ in adults . [ 8 ] Other signs of meningism include the presence of positive Kernig 's sign or Brudzi\u0144ski sign . Kernig 's sign is assessed with the person lying supine , with the hip and knee flexed to 90 degrees . In a person with a positive Kernig 's sign , pain limits passive extension of the knee . A positive Brudzinski 's sign occurs when flexion of the neck causes involuntary flexion of the knee and hip . Although Kernig 's sign and Brudzinski 's sign are both commonly used to screen for *$%^ , the sensitivity of these tests is limited . [ 8 ] [ 11 ] They do , however , have very good specificity for *$%^ : the signs rarely occur in other diseases . [ 8 ] Another test , known as the `` jolt accentuation maneuver '' helps determine whether *$%^ is present in those reporting fever and headache . A person is asked to rapidly rotate the head horizontally ; if this does not make the headache worse , *$%^ is unlikely . [ 8 ] *$%^ caused by the bacterium Neisseria meningitidis ( known as `` meningococcal *$%^ '' ) can be differentiated from *$%^ with other causes by a rapidly spreading petechial rash , which may precede other symptoms . [ 9 ] The rash consists of numerous small , irregular purple or red spots ( `` petechiae '' ) on the trunk , lower extremities , mucous membranes , conjuctiva , and ( occasionally ) the palms of the hands or soles of the feet . The rash is typically non-blanching ; the redness does not disappear when pressed with a finger or a glass tumbler . Although this rash is not necessarily present in meningococcal *$%^ , it is relatively specific for the disease ; it does , however , occasionally occur in *$%^ due to other bacteria . [ 2 ] Other clues on the cause of *$%^ may be the skin signs of hand , foot and mouth disease and genital herpes , both of which are associated with various forms of viral *$%^ . [ 12 ] Additional problems may occur in the early stage of the illness . These may require specific treatment , and sometimes indicate severe illness or worse prognosis . The infection may trigger sepsis , a systemic inflammatory response syndrome of falling blood pressure , fast heart rate , high or abnormally low temperature , and rapid breathing . Very low blood pressure may occur at an early stage , especially but not exclusively in meningococcal *$%^ ; this may lead to insufficient blood supply to other organs . [ 2 ] Disseminated intravascular coagulation , the excessive activation of blood clotting , may obstruct blood flow to organs and paradoxically increase the bleeding risk . Gangrene of limbs can occur in meningococcal disease . [ 2 ] Severe meningococcal and pneumococcal infections may result in hemorrhaging of the adrenal glands , leading to Waterhouse-Friderichsen syndrome , which is often fatal . [ 13 ] The brain tissue may swell , pressure inside the skull may increase and the swollen brain may herniate through the skull base . This may be noticed by a decreasing level of consciousness , loss of the pupillary light reflex , and abnormal posturing . [ 5 ] The inflammation of the brain tissue may also obstruct the normal flow of CSF around the brain ( hydrocephalus ) . [ 5 ] Seizures may occur for various reasons ; in children , seizures are common in the early stages of *$%^ ( in 30 % of cases ) and do not necessarily indicate an underlying cause . [ 4 ] Seizures may result from increased pressure and from areas of inflammation in the brain tissue . [ 5 ] Focal seizures ( seizures that involve one limb or part of the body ) , persistent seizures , late-onset seizures and those that are difficult to control with medication indicate a poorer long-term outcome . [ 2 ] Inflammation of the meninges may lead to abnormalities of the cranial nerves , a group of nerves arising from the brain stem that supply the head and neck area and which control , among other functions , eye movement , facial muscles , and hearing . [ 2 ] [ 8 ] Visual symptoms and hearing loss may persist after an episode of *$%^ . [ 2 ] Inflammation of the brain ( encephalitis ) or its blood vessels ( cerebral vasculitis ) , as well as the formation of blood clots in the veins ( cerebral venous thrombosis ) , may all lead to weakness , loss of sensation , or abnormal movement or function of the part of the body supplied by the affected area of the brain . [ 2 ] [ 5 ]", "Meningitis"], ["Typically , people infected with *$%^ virus are asymptomatic ( 80 % ) or have only mild symptoms such as an uncomplicated *$%^ . [ 2 ] [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Others have more severe illness ( 5 % ) , and in a small proportion it is life-threatening . [ 2 ] [ 5 ] The incubation period ( time between exposure and onset of symptoms ) ranges from 3 to 14 days , but most often it is 4 to 7 days . [ 6 ] Therefore , travelers returning from endemic areas are unlikely to have *$%^ if *$%^ or other symptoms start more than 14 days after arriving home . [ 7 ] Children often experience symptoms similar to those of the common cold and gastroenteritis ( vomiting and diarrhea ) [ 8 ] and have a greater risk of severe complications , [ 7 ] [ 9 ] though initial symptoms are generally mild but include high *$%^ . [ 9 ] The characteristic symptoms of *$%^ are sudden-onset *$%^ , headache ( typically located behind the eyes ) , muscle and joint pains , and a rash . The alternative name for *$%^ , `` breakbone *$%^ '' , comes from the associated muscle and joint pains . [ 2 ] [ 11 ] The course of infection is divided into three phases : febrile , critical , and recovery . [ 10 ] The febrile phase involves high *$%^ , potentially over 40 \u00b0C ( 104 \u00b0F ) , and is associated with generalized pain and a headache ; this usually lasts two to seven days . [ 10 ] [ 11 ] Nausea and vomiting may also occur . [ 9 ] A rash occurs in 50\u201380 % of those with symptoms [ 11 ] [ 12 ] in the first or second day of symptoms as flushed skin , or later in the course of illness ( days 4\u20137 ) , as a measles-like rash . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] A rash described as `` islands of white in a sea of red '' has also been observed . [ 14 ] Some petechiae ( small red spots that do not disappear when the skin is pressed , which are caused by broken capillaries ) can appear at this point , [ 10 ] as may some mild bleeding from the mucous membranes of the mouth and nose . [ 7 ] [ 11 ] The *$%^ itself is classically biphasic or saddleback in nature , breaking and then returning for one or two days . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] In some people , the disease proceeds to a critical phase as *$%^ resolves . [ 9 ] During this period , there is leakage of plasma from the blood vessels , typically lasting one to two days . [ 10 ] This may result in fluid accumulation in the chest and abdominal cavity as well as depletion of fluid from the circulation and decreased blood supply to vital organs . [ 10 ] There may also be organ dysfunction and severe bleeding , typically from the gastrointestinal tract . [ 7 ] [ 10 ] Shock ( *$%^ shock syndrome ) and hemorrhage ( *$%^ hemorrhagic *$%^ ) occur in less than 5 % of all cases of *$%^ , [ 7 ] however those who have previously been infected with other serotypes of *$%^ virus ( `` secondary infection '' ) are at an increased risk . [ 7 ] [ 15 ] This critical phase , while rare , occurs relatively more commonly in children and young adults . [ 9 ] The recovery phase occurs next , with resorption of the leaked fluid into the bloodstream . [ 10 ] This usually lasts two to three days . [ 7 ] The improvement is often striking , and can be accompanied with severe itching and a slow heart rate . [ 7 ] [ 10 ] Another rash may occur with either a maculopapular or a vasculitic appearance , which is followed by peeling of the skin . [ 9 ] During this stage , a fluid overload state may occur ; if it affects the brain , it may cause a reduced level of consciousness or seizures . [ 7 ] A feeling of fatigue may last for weeks in adults . [ 9 ] *$%^ can occasionally affect several other body systems , [ 10 ] either in isolation or along with the classic *$%^ symptoms . [ 8 ] A decreased level of consciousness occurs in 0.5\u20136 % of severe cases , which is attributable either to inflammation of the brain by the virus or indirectly as a result of impairment of vital organs , for example , the liver . [ 8 ] [ 14 ] [ 16 ] Other neurological disorders have been reported in the context of *$%^ , such as transverse myelitis and Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome . [ 8 ] [ 16 ] Infection of the heart and acute liver failure are among the rarer complications . [ 7 ] [ 10 ]", "Dengue fever"], ["Respiratory infection in humans is relatively rare and initially presents with cold or flu-like symptoms for several days , followed by pneumonia and severe ( and often fatal ) respiratory collapse . Historical mortality rates were over 85 % , [ 12 ] but , when treated early ( seen in the 2001 *$%^ attacks ) , observed case fatality rate dropped to 45 % . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Distinguishing pulmonary *$%^ from more common causes of respiratory illness is essential to avoiding delays in diagnosis and thereby improving outcomes . An algorithm for this purpose has been developed . [ 14 ] A lethal infection is reported to result from inhalation of about 10,000\u201320,000 spores , though this dose varies among host species . [ 15 ] As with all diseases , a wide variation in susceptibility is presumed , with evidence indicating some people may die from much lower exposures ; little documented evidence is available to verify the exact or average number of spores needed for infection . Inhalational *$%^ is also known as woolsorters ' or ragpickers ' disease . These professions were more susceptible to the disease due to their exposure to infected animal products . Other practices associated with exposure include the slicing up of animal horns for the manufacture of buttons , the handling of hair bristles used for the manufacturing of brushes , and the handling of animal skins . Whether these animal skins came from animals that died of the disease or from animals that had simply lain on ground with spores on it is unknown . Gastrointestinal ( GI ) infection in humans is most often caused by consuming anthrax-infected meat and is characterized by serious GI difficulty , vomiting of blood , severe diarrhea , acute inflammation of the intestinal tract , and loss of appetite . [ 16 ] Lesions have been found in the intestines and in the mouth and throat . After the bacterium invades the bowel system , it spreads through the bloodstream throughout the body , while also continuing to make toxins . GI infections can be treated , but usually result in fatality rates of 25 % to 60 % , depending upon how soon treatment commences . This form of *$%^ is the rarest form . In the United States , only two official cases have occurred , the first reported in 1942 by the CDC and the second reported in 2010 that was treated at the Massachusetts General Hospital . [ 17 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] It is the only known case of survival from GI *$%^ in the United States . An outbreak of *$%^ among people who had eaten meat from a dead carabao was reported in Cagayan Province in the Philippines in early 2010 , with over 400 cases of illness and at least two fatalities . [ 10 ] Cutaneous *$%^ , also known as Hide porter 's disease , is the cutaneous ( on the skin ) manifestation of *$%^ infection in humans . It presents as a boil-like skin lesion that eventually forms an ulcer with a black center ( eschar ) . The black eschar often shows up as a large , painless necrotic ulcer ( beginning as an irritating and itchy skin lesion or blister that is dark and usually concentrated as a black dot , somewhat resembling bread mold ) at the site of infection . In general , cutaneous infections form within the site of spore penetration between two and five days after exposure . Unlike bruises or most other lesions , cutaneous *$%^ infections normally do not cause pain . [ 20 ] Cutaneous *$%^ is typically caused when B. anthracis spores enter through cuts on the skin . This form is found most commonly when humans handle infected animals and/or animal products . Cutaneous *$%^ is rarely fatal if treated , [ 13 ] because the infection area is limited to the skin , preventing the lethal factor , edema factor , and protective antigen from entering and destroying a vital organ . Without treatment , about 20 % of cutaneous skin infection cases progress to toxemia and death .", "Anthrax"], ["The classic symptoms of untreated *$%^ are weight loss , polyuria ( increased urination ) , polydipsia ( increased thirst ) , and polyphagia ( increased hunger ) . [ 17 ] Symptoms may develop rapidly ( weeks or months ) in type 1 DM , while they usually develop much more slowly and may be subtle or absent in type 2 DM . Several other signs and symptoms can mark the onset of *$%^ , although they are not specific to the disease . In addition to the known ones above , they include blurry vision , headache , fatigue , slow healing of cuts , and itchy skin . Prolonged high blood glucose can cause glucose absorption in the lens of the eye , which leads to changes in its shape , resulting in vision changes . A number of skin rashes that can occur in *$%^ are collectively known as diabetic dermadromes . Low blood sugar is common in persons with type 1 and type 2 DM . Most cases are mild and are not considered medical emergencies . Effects can range from feelings of unease , sweating , trembling , and increased appetite in mild cases to more serious issues such as confusion , changes in behavior , seizures , unconsciousness , and ( rarely ) permanent brain damage or death in severe cases . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Mild cases are self-treated by eating or drinking something high in sugar . Severe cases can lead to unconsciousness and must be treated with intravenous glucose or injections with glucagon . People ( usually with type 1 DM ) may also experience episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis , a metabolic disturbance characterized by nausea , vomiting and abdominal pain , the smell of acetone on the breath , deep breathing known as Kussmaul breathing , and in severe cases a decreased level of consciousness . [ 20 ] A rare but equally severe possibility is hyperosmolar nonketotic state , which is more common in type 2 DM and is mainly the result of dehydration . [ 20 ] All forms of *$%^ increase the risk of long-term complications . These typically develop after many years ( 10\u201320 ) , but may be the first symptom in those who have otherwise not received a diagnosis before that time . The major long-term complications relate to damage to blood vessels . *$%^ doubles the risk of cardiovascular disease [ 21 ] and about 75 % of deaths in diabetics are due to coronary artery disease . [ 22 ] Other `` macrovascular '' diseases are stroke , and peripheral vascular disease . The primary complications of *$%^ due to damage in small blood vessels include damage to the eyes , kidneys , and nerves . [ 23 ] Damage to the eyes , known as diabetic retinopathy , is caused by damage to the blood vessels in the retina of the eye , and can result in gradual vision loss and blindness . [ 23 ] Damage to the kidneys , known as diabetic nephropathy , can lead to tissue scarring , urine protein loss , and eventually chronic kidney disease , sometimes requiring dialysis or kidney transplant . [ 23 ] Damage to the nerves of the body , known as diabetic neuropathy , is the most common complication of *$%^ . [ 23 ] The symptoms can include numbness , tingling , pain , and altered pain sensation , which can lead to damage to the skin . Diabetes-related foot problems ( such as diabetic foot ulcers ) may occur , and can be difficult to treat , occasionally requiring amputation . Additionally , proximal diabetic neuropathy causes painful muscle wasting and weakness . There is a link between cognitive deficit and *$%^ . Compared to those without *$%^ , those with the disease have a 1.2 to 1.5-fold greater rate of decline in cognitive function . [ 24 ]", "Diabetes mellitus"], ["*$%^ is characterized by recurrent episodes of wheezing , shortness of breath , chest tightness , and coughing . [ 17 ] Sputum may be produced from the lung by coughing but is often hard to bring up . [ 18 ] During recovery from an attack , it may appear pus-like due to high levels of white blood cells called eosinophils . [ 19 ] Symptoms are usually worse at night and in the early morning or in response to exercise or cold air . [ 20 ] Some people with *$%^ rarely experience symptoms , usually in response to triggers , whereas others may have marked and persistent symptoms . [ 21 ] A number of other health conditions occur more frequently in those with *$%^ , including gastro-esophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) , rhinosinusitis , and obstructive sleep apnea . [ 22 ] Psychological disorders are also more common , [ 23 ] with anxiety disorders occurring in between 16\u201352 % and mood disorders in 14\u201341 % . [ 24 ] However , it is not known if *$%^ causes psychological problems or if psychological problems lead to *$%^ . [ 25 ] Those with *$%^ , especially if it is poorly controlled , are at high risk for radiocontrast reactions . [ 26 ]", "Asthma"], ["*$%^ often begins with mild spasms in the jaw muscles\u2014also known as lockjaw or trismus . The spasms can also affect the facial muscles resulting in an appearance called risus sardonicus . Chest , neck , back , abdominal muscles , and buttocks may be affected . Back muscle spasms often cause arching , called opisthotonos . Sometimes the spasms affect muscles that help with breathing , which can lead to breathing problems . [ 6 ] Prolonged muscular action causes sudden , powerful , and painful contractions of muscle groups , which is called `` tetany '' . These episodes can cause fractures and muscle tears . Other symptoms include drooling , excessive sweating , fever , hand or foot spasms , irritability , difficulty swallowing , suffocation , heart attack , breathing problems , irregular heartbeat , and uncontrolled urination or defecation . The episodes can also cause destruction of elements of the nervous system through viral cell exchange . With treatment about 10 % of people who contract *$%^ die . [ 6 ] The mortality rate is higher in unvaccinated people and people over 60 years of age . [ 6 ] The incubation period of *$%^ may be up to several months , but is usually about eight days . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] In general , the farther the injury site is from the central nervous system , the longer the incubation period . The shorter the incubation period , the more severe the symptoms . [ 9 ] In neonatal *$%^ , symptoms usually appear from 4 to 14 days after birth , averaging about 7 days . On the basis of clinical findings , four different forms of *$%^ have been described . [ 6 ] Generalized *$%^ is the most common type of *$%^ , representing about 80 % of cases . The generalized form usually presents with a descending pattern . The first sign is trismus , or lockjaw , and the facial spasms called risus sardonicus , followed by stiffness of the neck , difficulty in swallowing , and rigidity of pectoral and calf muscles . Other symptoms include elevated temperature , sweating , elevated blood pressure , and episodic rapid heart rate . Spasms may occur frequently and last for several minutes with the body shaped into a characteristic form called opisthotonos . Spasms continue for up to four weeks , and complete recovery may take months . [ citation needed ] Sympathetic overactivity ( SOA ) is common in severe *$%^ and manifests as labile hypertension , tachycardia , dysrhythmia , peripheral vasculature constriction , profuse sweating , fever , increased carbon dioxide output , increased catecholamine excretion and late development of hypotension . Death can occur within four days . Neonatal *$%^ is a form of generalized *$%^ that occurs in newborns , usually those born to mothers who themselves have not been vaccinated . If the mother has been vaccinated against *$%^ , the infants acquire passive immunity and are thus protected . [ 10 ] It usually occurs through infection of the unhealed umbilical stump , particularly when the stump is cut with a non-sterile instrument . As of 1998 neonatal *$%^ was common in many developing countries and was responsible for about 14 % ( 215,000 ) of all neonatal deaths . [ 11 ] In 2010 the worldwide death toll was 58,000 newborns . As the result of a public health campaign , the death toll from neonatal *$%^ was reduced by 90 % between 1990 and 2010 , and by 2013 the disease had been largely eliminated from all but 25 countries . [ 12 ] Neonatal *$%^ is rare in developed countries . Local *$%^ is an uncommon form of the disease , in which patients have persistent contraction of muscles in the same anatomic area as the injury . The contractions may persist for many weeks before gradually subsiding . Local *$%^ is generally milder ; only about 1 % of cases are fatal , but it may precede the onset of generalized *$%^ . [ citation needed ] Cephalic *$%^ is the rarest form of the disease ( 0.9\u20133 % of cases ) [ 13 ] and is limited to muscles and nerves in the head . [ 14 ] It usually occurs after trauma to the head area , including skull fracture , [ 15 ] laceration , [ 15 ] eye injury , [ 14 ] dental extraction , [ 16 ] and otitis media , [ 17 ] but it has been observed from injuries to other parts of the body . [ 18 ] Paralysis of the facial nerve is most frequently implicated , which may cause lockjaw , facial palsy , or ptosis , but other cranial nerves can also be affected . [ 16 ] [ 19 ] Cephalic *$%^ may progress to a more generalized form of the disease . [ 13 ] [ 19 ] Due to its rarity , clinicians may be unfamiliar with the clinical presentation and may not suspect *$%^ as the illness . [ 14 ] Treatment can be complicated as symptoms may be concurrent with the initial injury that caused the infection . [ 15 ] Cephalic *$%^ is more likely than other forms of *$%^ to be fatal , with the progression to generalized *$%^ carrying a 15\u201330 % case fatality rate . [ 13 ] [ 15 ] [ 19 ]", "Tetanus"], ["All three findings , especially fever , were less sensitive in people over 60 years of age . Approximately 33 % of people with *$%^ are asymptomatic . [ 14 ] Symptoms of *$%^ can start quite suddenly one to two days after infection . Usually the first symptoms are chills or a chilly sensation , but fever is also common early in the infection , with body temperatures ranging from 38 to 39 \u00b0C ( approximately 100 to 103 \u00b0F ) . [ 15 ] Many people are so ill that they are confined to bed for several days , with aches and pains throughout their bodies , which are worse in their backs and legs . [ 16 ] Symptoms of *$%^ may include : Fever and extreme coldness ( chills shivering , shaking ( rigor ) ) Cough Nasal congestion Runny nose Sneezing Body aches , especially joints and throat Fatigue Headache Irritated , watering eyes Reddened eyes , skin ( especially face ) , mouth , throat and nose Petechial rash [ 17 ] In children , gastrointestinal symptoms such as diarrhea and abdominal pain , [ 18 ] [ 19 ] ( may be severe in children with *$%^ B ) [ 20 ] It can be difficult to distinguish between the common cold and *$%^ in the early stages of these infections , [ 21 ] but a flu can be identified by a high fever with a sudden onset and extreme fatigue . *$%^ is a mixture of symptoms of common cold and pneumonia , body ache , headache , and fatigue . Diarrhea is not normally a symptom of *$%^ in adults , [ 12 ] although it has been seen in some human cases of the H5N1 `` bird flu '' [ 22 ] and can be a symptom in children . [ 18 ] The symptoms most reliably seen in *$%^ are shown in the table to the right . [ 12 ] Since antiviral drugs are effective in treating *$%^ if given early ( see treatment section , below ) , it can be important to identify cases early . Of the symptoms listed above , the combinations of fever with cough , sore throat and/or nasal congestion can improve diagnostic accuracy . [ 23 ] Two decision analysis studies [ 24 ] [ 25 ] suggest that during local outbreaks of *$%^ , the prevalence will be over 70 % , [ 25 ] and thus patients with any of these combinations of symptoms may be treated with neuraminidase inhibitors without testing . Even in the absence of a local outbreak , treatment may be justified in the elderly during the *$%^ season as long as the prevalence is over 15 % . [ 25 ] The available laboratory tests for *$%^ continue to improve . The United States Centers for Disease Control and Prevention ( CDC ) maintains an up-to-date summary of available laboratory tests . [ 26 ] According to the CDC , rapid diagnostic tests have a sensitivity of 70\u201375 % and specificity of 90\u201395 % when compared with viral culture . These tests may be especially useful during the *$%^ season ( prevalence=25 % ) but in the absence of a local outbreak , or peri-influenza season ( prevalence=10 % [ 25 ] ) . Occasionally , *$%^ can cause severe illness including primary viral pneumonia or secondary bacterial pneumonia . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] The obvious symptom is trouble breathing . In addition , if a child ( or presumably an adult ) seems to be getting better and then relapses with a high fever , that is a danger sign since this relapse can be bacterial pneumonia . [ 29 ]", "Influenza"], ["The condition may be due to : *$%^ *$%^ , and its variations ( i.e . mosaicism ) XX *$%^ *$%^ , also pure *$%^ *$%^ , 46 , XX Swyer *$%^ , also pure *$%^ *$%^ , 46 , XY Perrault *$%^ , XX *$%^ *$%^ + sensorineural hearing loss Mixed *$%^ *$%^ Exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors", "Turner syndrome"], ["A person with MS can have almost any neurological symptom or sign , with autonomic , visual , motor , and sensory problems being the most common . [ 1 ] The specific symptoms are determined by the locations of the lesions within the nervous system , and may include loss of sensitivity or changes in sensation such as tingling , pins and needles or numbness , muscle weakness , very pronounced reflexes , muscle spasms , or difficulty in moving ; difficulties with coordination and balance ( ataxia ) ; problems with speech or swallowing , visual problems ( nystagmus , optic neuritis or double vision ) , feeling tired , acute or chronic pain , and bladder and bowel difficulties , among others . [ 1 ] Difficulties thinking and emotional problems such as depression or unstable mood are also common . [ 1 ] Uhthoff 's phenomenon , a worsening of symptoms due to exposure to higher than usual temperatures , and Lhermitte 's sign , an electrical sensation that runs down the back when bending the neck , are particularly characteristic of MS. [ 1 ] The main measure of disability and severity is the expanded disability status scale ( EDSS ) , with other measures such as the *$%^ *$%^ functional composite being increasingly used in research . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] [ 15 ] The condition begins in 85 % of cases as a clinically isolated syndrome over a number of days with 45 % having motor or sensory problems , 20 % having optic neuritis , and 10 % having symptoms related to brainstem dysfunction , while the remaining 25 % have more than one of the previous difficulties . [ 16 ] The course of symptoms occurs in two main patterns initially : either as episodes of sudden worsening that last a few days to months ( called relapses , exacerbations , bouts , attacks , or flare-ups ) followed by improvement ( 85 % of cases ) or as a gradual worsening over time without periods of recovery ( 10-15 % of cases ) . [ 11 ] A combination of these two patterns may also occur [ 4 ] or people may start in a relapsing and remitting course that then becomes progressive later on . [ 11 ] Relapses are usually not predictable , occurring without warning . [ 1 ] Exacerbations rarely occur more frequently than twice per year . [ 1 ] Some relapses , however , are preceded by common triggers and they occur more frequently during spring and summer . [ 17 ] Similarly , viral infections such as the common cold , influenza , or gastroenteritis increase their risk . [ 1 ] Stress may also trigger an attack . [ 18 ] Women with MS who become pregnant experience fewer relapses ; however , during the first months after delivery the risk increases . [ 1 ] Overall , pregnancy does not seem to influence long-term disability . [ 1 ] Many events have not been found to affect relapse rates including vaccination , breast feeding , [ 1 ] physical trauma , [ 19 ] and Uhthoff 's phenomenon . [ 17 ]", "Multiple sclerosis"], ["Forgetting things occasionally Misplacing items sometimes Minor short-term memory loss Not remembering exact details Not remembering episodes of forgetfulness Forgets names of family or friends Changes may only be noticed by close friends or relatives Some confusion in situations outside the familiar Greater difficulty remembering recently learned information Deepening confusion in many circumstances Problems with sleep Trouble knowing where they are Poor ability to think Problems speaking Repeats same conversations More abusive , anxious , or paranoid The *$%^ course is divided into four stages , with a progressive pattern of cognitive and functional impairment . The first symptoms are often mistakenly attributed to ageing or stress . [ 19 ] Detailed neuropsychological testing can reveal mild cognitive difficulties up to eight years before a person fulfills the clinical criteria for diagnosis of AD . [ 20 ] These early symptoms can affect the most complex daily living activities . [ 21 ] The most noticeable deficit is short term memory loss , which shows up as difficulty in remembering recently learned facts and inability to acquire new information . [ 20 ] [ 22 ] Subtle problems with the executive functions of attentiveness , planning , flexibility , and abstract thinking , or impairments in semantic memory ( memory of meanings , and concept relationships ) can also be symptomatic of the early stages of AD . [ 20 ] Apathy can be observed at this stage , and remains the most persistent neuropsychiatric symptom throughout the course of the *$%^ . [ 23 ] Depressive symptoms , irritability and reduced awareness of subtle memory difficulties are also common . [ 24 ] The preclinical stage of the *$%^ has also been termed mild cognitive impairment ( MCI ) . [ 22 ] This is often found to be a transitional stage between normal ageing and dementia . MCI can present with a variety of symptoms , and when memory loss is the predominant symptom , it is termed `` amnestic MCI '' and is frequently seen as a prodromal stage of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . [ 25 ] In people with AD , the increasing impairment of learning and memory eventually leads to a definitive diagnosis . In a small percentage , difficulties with language , executive functions , perception ( agnosia ) , or execution of movements ( apraxia ) are more prominent than memory problems . [ 26 ] AD does not affect all memory capacities equally . Older memories of the person *$%^ life ( episodic memory ) , facts learned ( semantic memory ) , and implicit memory ( the memory of the body on how to do things , such as using a fork to eat ) are affected to a lesser degree than new facts or memories . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] Language problems are mainly characterised by a shrinking vocabulary and decreased word fluency , leading to a general impoverishment of oral and written language . [ 26 ] [ 29 ] In this stage , the person with *$%^ *$%^ is usually capable of communicating basic ideas adequately . [ 26 ] [ 29 ] [ 30 ] While performing fine motor tasks such as writing , drawing or dressing , certain movement coordination and planning difficulties ( apraxia ) may be present , but they are commonly unnoticed . [ 26 ] As the *$%^ progresses , people with AD can often continue to perform many tasks independently , but may need assistance or supervision with the most cognitively demanding activities . [ 26 ] Progressive deterioration eventually hinders independence , with subjects being unable to perform most common activities of daily living . [ 26 ] Speech difficulties become evident due to an inability to recall vocabulary , which leads to frequent incorrect word substitutions ( paraphasias ) . Reading and writing skills are also progressively lost . [ 26 ] [ 30 ] Complex motor sequences become less coordinated as time passes and AD progresses , so the risk of falling increases . [ 26 ] During this phase , memory problems worsen , and the person may fail to recognise close relatives . [ 26 ] Long-term memory , which was previously intact , becomes impaired . [ 26 ] Behavioural and neuropsychiatric changes become more prevalent . Common manifestations are wandering , irritability and labile affect , leading to crying , outbursts of unpremeditated aggression , or resistance to caregiving . [ 26 ] Sundowning can also appear . [ 31 ] Approximately 30 % of people with AD develop illusionary misidentifications and other delusional symptoms . [ 26 ] Subjects also lose insight of their *$%^ process and limitations ( anosognosia ) . [ 26 ] Urinary incontinence can develop . [ 26 ] These symptoms create stress for relatives and carers , which can be reduced by moving the person from home care to other long-term care facilities . [ 26 ] [ 32 ] During the final stages , the patient is completely dependent upon caregivers . [ 26 ] Language is reduced to simple phrases or even single words , eventually leading to complete loss of speech . [ 26 ] [ 30 ] Despite the loss of verbal language abilities , people can often understand and return emotional signals . Although aggressiveness can still be present , extreme apathy and exhaustion are much more common symptoms . People with *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ will ultimately not be able to perform even the simplest tasks independently ; muscle mass and mobility deteriorate to the point where they are bedridden and unable to feed themselves . The cause of death is usually an external factor , such as infection of pressure ulcers or pneumonia , not the *$%^ itself . [ 26 ]", "Alzheimer's disease"], ["The signs and symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ virtually all result from the direct and indirect effects of hyperthyroidism , with main exceptions being *$%^ *$%^ ophthalmopathy , goitre , and pretibial myxedema ( which are caused by the autoimmune processes of the *$%^ ) . Symptoms of the resultant hyperthyroidism are mainly insomnia , hand tremor , hyperactivity , hair loss , excessive sweating , shaking hands , itching , heat intolerance , weight loss despite increased appetite , diarrhea , frequent defecation , palpitations , muscle weakness , and skin warmth and moistness . [ 5 ] Further signs that may be seen on physical examination are most commonly a diffusely enlarged ( usually symmetric ) , nontender thyroid , lid lag , excessive lacrimation due to *$%^ *$%^ ophthalmopathy , arrhythmias of the heart , such as sinus tachycardia , atrial fibrillation , and premature ventricular contractions , and hypertension . [ 5 ] People with hyperthyroidism may experience behavioral and personality changes , including : psychosis , mania , anxiety , agitation , and depression . [ 6 ]", "Graves' disease"], ["ALD can present in different ways . The different presentations are complicated by the pattern of X-linked recessive inheritance . There have been seven phenotypes described in males with ABCD1 mutations and five in females . [ 1 ] Initial symptoms in boys affected with the childhood cerebral form of ALD include emotional instability , hyperactivity and disruptive behavior at school . Older patients affected with the cerebral form will present with similar symptoms . Untreated , cerebral ALD is characterized by progressive demyelination leading to a vegetative state and death . [ 2 ] Adult males with an adrenomyeloneuropathy presentation typically present initially with muscle stiffness , paraparesis and sexual dysfunction . [ 3 ] All patients with clinically recognized ALD phenotypes are at risk for adrenal insufficiency . [ 2 ] There is no reliable way to predict which form of the disease an affected individual will develop , with multiple phenotypes being demonstrated within families . [ 4 ] Onset of adrenal insufficiency is often the first symptom , appearing as early as two years of age . [ 3 ]", "Adrenoleukodystrophy"], ["Although 20\u201325 % of women with *$%^ have no symptoms , pain and infertility are common signs . [ 2 ] A major symptom of *$%^ is recurring pelvic pain . The pain can range from mild to severe cramping or stabbing pain that occurs on both sides of the pelvis , in the lower back and rectal area , and even down the legs . The amount of pain a woman feels correlates poorly with the extent or stage ( 1 through 4 ) of *$%^ , with some women having little or no pain despite having extensive *$%^ or *$%^ with scarring , while other women may have severe pain even though they have only a few small areas of *$%^ . [ 8 ] Symptoms of endometriosis-related pain may include : [ 9 ] dysmenorrhea \u2013 painful , sometimes disabling cramps during the menstrual period ; pain may get worse over time ( progressive pain ) , also lower back pains linked to the pelvis chronic pelvic pain \u2013 typically accompanied by lower back pain or abdominal pain dyspareunia \u2013 painful sex dysuria \u2013 urinary urgency , frequency , and sometimes painful voiding Throbbing , gnawing , and dragging pain to the legs are reported more commonly by women with *$%^ . [ unreliable medical source ? ] [ 10 ] Compared with women with superficial *$%^ , those with deep disease appear to be more likely to report shooting rectal pain and a sense of their insides being pulled down . [ 10 ] Individual pain areas and pain intensity appears to be unrelated to the surgical diagnosis , and the area of pain unrelated to area of *$%^ . [ 10 ] *$%^ lesions react to hormonal stimulation and may `` bleed '' at the time of menstruation . The blood accumulates locally , causes swelling , and triggers inflammatory responses with the activation of cytokines . This process may cause pain . Pain can also occur from adhesions ( internal scar tissue ) binding internal organs to each other , causing organ dislocation . Fallopian tubes , ovaries , the uterus , the bowels , and the bladder can be bound together in ways that are painful on a daily basis , not just during menstrual periods . [ 11 ] Also , endometriotic lesions can develop their own nerve supply , thereby creating a direct and two-way interaction between lesions and the central nervous system , potentially producing a variety of individual differences in pain that can , in some women , become independent of the disease itself . [ 8 ] Nerve fibres and blood vessels are thought to grow into *$%^ lesions by a process known as Neuroangiogenesis . [ 12 ] Many women with infertility may have *$%^ . Among women with *$%^ , up to half may experience infertility . [ 2 ] Other symptoms include diarrhea or constipation , [ unreliable medical source ? ] [ 10 ] chronic fatigue , [ medical citation needed ] nausea and vomiting , headaches , low-grade fevers , heavy and/or irregular periods , and hypoglycemia . [ unreliable medical source ? ] [ 13 ] In addition to pain during menstruation , the pain of *$%^ can occur at other times of the month . There can be pain with ovulation , pain associated with adhesions , pain caused by inflammation in the pelvic cavity , pain during bowel movements and urination , during general bodily movement like exercise , pain from standing or walking , and pain with intercourse . But the most desperate pain is usually with menstruation and many women dread having their periods . Pain can also start a week before a menstrual period , during and even a week after a menstrual period , or it can be constant . The pain can be debilitating and the emotional stress can take a toll . [ 14 ] There is an association between *$%^ and certain types of cancers , notably some types of ovarian cancer , [ 15 ] [ 16 ] non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and brain cancer . [ 17 ] Despite similarities in their name and location , *$%^ bears no relationship to endometrial cancer . [ 18 ] *$%^ often also coexists with leiomyoma or adenomyosis , but studies that look into similarities and differences between *$%^ and adenomyosis have conflicting results .

[ 7 ] The symptoms of CRPS usually initially manifest near the site of a , typically minor , injury . The most common symptoms are *$%^ sensations , including burning , stabbing , grinding , and throbbing . Moving or touching the limb is often intolerable . The patient may also experience muscle spasms , local swelling , sensitivity to things such as water , touch , and vibrations , abnormally increased sweating , changes in skin temperature ( usually hot but sometimes cold ) and color ( bright red or a reddish violet ) , softening and thinning of bones , joint tenderness or stiffness , and/or restricted or painful movement . Falls , pre-syncope , and syncope ( fainting ) are infrequently reported , as are visual problems . *$%^ Osteoporosis is possible . The symptoms of CRPS vary in severity and duration . Since CRPS is a systemic problem , potentially any organ can be affected . The *$%^ of CRPS is continuous , and it is widely recognised that it can be heightened by emotional or physical stress . [ 8 ] *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ 's cause is unknown . Nerve damage is considered to be the cause in many cases . Evidence of nerve damage as the trigger for CRPS is supported by observations that the disruption of certain nerve relationships to *$%^ signaling result in improvements for patients . Patients are frequently classified into two groups based upon temperature : `` warm '' or `` hot '' CRPS in one group and `` cold '' CRPS in the other group . The majority of patients ( approximately 70 % ) have the `` hot '' type , which is said to be an acute form of CRPS . [ 9 ] Cold CRPS is said to be indicative of a more chronic CRPS and is associated with poorer McGill *$%^ Questionnaire ( MPQ ) scores , increased central nervous system involvement , and a higher prevalence of dystonia . [ 9 ] Prognosis is not favourable for cold CRPS patients ; longitudinal studies suggest these patients have `` poorer clinical *$%^ outcomes and show persistent signs of central sensitisation correlating with disease progression '' . [ 10 ] Previously it was considered that CRPS had three stages ; it is now believed that patients with CRPS do not progress through these stages sequentially . These stages may not be time-constrained and could possibly be event-related , such as ground-level falls or re-injuries of previously damaged areas . thus , rather than a progression of CRPS from bad to worse , it is now thought , instead , that patients are likely to have one of the three following types of disease progression : '' Stage '' one is characterized by severe , burning *$%^ at the site of the injury , muscle spasms , joint stiffness , restricted mobility , rapid hair and nail growth , and vasospasm . The vasospasm is that which causes the changes in the color and temperature of the skin . Some may experience hyperhydrosis ( increased sweating ) . In mild cases this stage lasts a few weeks , in which it can subside spontaneously or respond rapidly to treatment ( physical therapy , *$%^ specialist ) . `` Stage '' two is characterized by more intense *$%^ . Swelling spreads , hair growth diminishes , nails become cracked , brittle , grooved , and spotty , osteoporosis becomes severe and diffuse , joints thicken , and muscles atrophy . `` Stage '' three is characterized by irreversible changes in the skin and bones , while the *$%^ becomes unyielding and may involve the entire limb . There is marked muscle atrophy , severely limited mobility of the affected area , and flexor tendon contractions ( contractions of the muscles and tendons that flex the joints ) . Occasionally the limb is displaced from its normal position , and marked bone softening and thinning is more dispersed .", "Complex regional pain syndrome"], ["*$%^ ( NF1 ) in early life may cause learning and behavior problems , about 60 % of children who have NF1 have a mild form of difficulty in school .

If there is reduced vision , fluorescein angiography can be done to see the back of the eye . Narrowing or blocked retinal blood vessels can be seen clearly and this is called retinal ischemia ( lack of blood flow ) . Macular edema in which blood vessels leak their contents into the macular region can occur at any stage of NPDR . The symptoms of macular edema are blurred vision and darkened or distorted images that are not the same in both eyes . Ten percent ( 10 % ) of *$%^ patients will have vision loss related to macular edema . Optical Coherence Tomography can show the areas of retinal thickening ( due to fluid accumulation ) of macular edema . [ 6 ] In the second stage , abnormal new blood vessels ( neovascularisation ) form at the back of the eye as part of proliferative *$%^ *$%^ ( PDR ) ; these can burst and bleed ( vitreous hemorrhage ) and blur the vision , because these new blood vessels are fragile . The first time this bleeding occurs , it may not be very severe . In most cases , it will leave just a few specks of blood , or spots floating in a person 's visual field , though the spots often go away after a few hours . These spots are often followed within a few days or weeks by a much greater leakage of blood , which blurs the vision . In extreme cases , a person may only be able to tell light from dark in that eye . It may take the blood anywhere from a few days to months or even years to clear from the inside of the eye , and in some cases the blood will not clear . These types of large hemorrhages tend to happen more than once , often during sleep . On funduscopic exam , a doctor will see cotton wool spots , flame hemorrhages ( similar lesions are also caused by the alpha-toxin of Clostridium novyi ) , and dot-blot hemorrhages .", "Diabetic retinopathy"], ["*$%^ is a condition where sufferers become anxious in unfamiliar environments or where they perceive that they have little control . Triggers for this anxiety may include wide-open spaces , crowds ( social anxiety ) , or traveling ( even short distances ) . *$%^ is often , but not always , compounded by a fear of social embarrassment , as the agoraphobic fears the onset of a panic attack and appearing distraught in public . This is also sometimes called `` social *$%^ '' , which may be a subtype of social anxiety disorder . Not all *$%^ is social in nature , however . Some agoraphobics have an exclusive fear of open spaces . [ citation needed ] *$%^ is also defined as `` a fear , sometimes terrifying , by those who have experienced one or more panic attacks '' . [ citation needed ] In these cases , the sufferer is fearful of a particular place because they have experienced a panic attack at the same location at a previous time . Fearing the onset of another panic attack , the sufferer is fearful or even avoids location . Some refuse to leave their homes even in medical emergencies because the fear of being outside of their comfort areas is too great . [ citation needed ] Researchers have found similarities between symptoms of *$%^ and the stereotypical female sex roles cast upon society . Researchers assert the socialization of stereotypic feminine behavior \u2013 helplessness , dependence , unassertiveness , accommodation \u2013 contributes to the development and maintenance of the characteristics of *$%^ . [ 13 ] The sufferers can sometimes go to great lengths to avoid the locations where they have experienced the onset of a panic attack . *$%^ , as described in this manner , is actually a symptom professionals check when making a diagnosis of panic disorder . Other syndromes like obsessive compulsive disorder or post-traumatic stress disorder can also cause *$%^ . Essentially , any irrational fear that keeps one from going outside can cause the syndrome . [ 14 ] Agoraphobics not uncommonly also suffer from temporary separation anxiety disorder when certain other individuals of the household depart from the residence temporarily , such as a parent or spouse , or when the agoraphobic is left home alone . Such temporary conditions can result in an increase in anxiety or a panic attack or feeling the need to separate themselves from family or maybe friends . Another common associative disorder of *$%^ is thanatophobia , the fear of death . The anxiety level of agoraphobics often increases when dwelling upon the idea of eventually dying , which they may consciously or unconsciously associate with being the ultimate separation from their emotional comfort and safety zones and loved ones , even for those who may otherwise believe in some form of afterlife . [ citation needed ] *$%^ patients can experience sudden panic attacks when traveling to places where they fear they are out of control , help would be difficult to obtain , or they could be embarrassed . During a panic attack , epinephrine is released in large amounts , triggering the body 's natural fight-or-flight response . A panic attack typically has an abrupt onset , building to maximum intensity within 10 to 15 minutes , and rarely lasts longer than 30 minutes . [ 15 ] Symptoms of a panic attack include palpitations , rapid heartbeat , sweating , trembling , nausea , vomiting , dizziness , tightness in the throat , and shortness of breath . Many patients report a fear of dying or of losing control of emotions and/or behaviors . [ 15 ]", "Agoraphobia"], ["The symptoms of *$%^ usually begin two to seven days after infection . Symptoms of *$%^ include fever of 38 \u00b0C ( 100.4 \u00b0F ) or above , chills , fatigue , bluish skin coloration ( cyanosis ) , sore throat , hoarseness , cough , headache , difficulty swallowing , painful swallowing , difficulty breathing , rapid breathing , foul-smelling bloodstained nasal discharge and lymphadenopathy . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Symptoms can also include cardiac arrhythmias , myocarditis , and cranial and peripheral nerve palsies . Laryngeal *$%^ can lead to a characteristic swollen neck and throat , or `` bull neck '' . The swollen throat is often accompanied by a serious respiratory condition , characterized by a brassy or `` barking '' cough , stridor , hoarseness , and difficulty breathing , and historically referred to variously as `` diphtheritic croup '' , [ 9 ] `` true croup '' , [ 10 ] [ 11 ] or sometimes simply as `` croup '' . [ 12 ] Diphtheritic croup is extremely rare in countries where *$%^ vaccination is customary . As a result , the term `` croup '' nowadays most often refers to an unrelated viral illness that produces similar but milder respiratory symptoms . [ 13 ]", "Diphtheria"], ["The main sites of copper accumulation are the liver and the brain , and consequently liver *$%^ and neuropsychiatric symptoms are the main features that lead to diagnosis . [ 1 ] People with liver problems tend to come to medical attention earlier , generally as children or teenagers , than those with neurological and psychiatric symptoms , who tend to be in their twenties or older . Some are identified only because relatives have been diagnosed with *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ ; many of these , when tested , turn out to have been experiencing symptoms of the condition but have not received a diagnosis . [ 3 ] Liver *$%^ may present itself as tiredness , increased bleeding tendency or confusion ( due to hepatic encephalopathy ) and portal hypertension . The latter , a condition in which the pressure in the portal vein is markedly increased , leads to esophageal varices , blood vessels in the esophagus that may bleed in a life-threatening fashion , as well as enlargement of the spleen ( splenomegaly ) and accumulation of fluid in the abdominal cavity ( ascites ) . On examination , signs of chronic liver *$%^ such as spider angiomata ( small distended blood vessels , usually on the chest ) may be observed . Chronic active hepatitis has caused cirrhosis of the liver in most by the time they develop symptoms . While most people with cirrhosis have an increased risk of hepatocellular carcinoma ( liver cancer ) , this risk is relatively very low in *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . [ 1 ] About 5 % of all people are diagnosed only when they develop fulminant acute liver failure , often in the context of a hemolytic anemia ( anemia due to the destruction of red blood cells ) . This leads to abnormalities in protein production ( identified by deranged coagulation ) and metabolism by the liver . The deranged protein metabolism leads to the accumulation of waste products such as ammonia in the bloodstream . When these irritate the brain , the person develops hepatic encephalopathy ( confusion , coma , seizures and finally life-threatening swelling of the brain ) . [ 1 ] About half the people with *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ have neurological or psychiatric symptoms . Most initially have mild cognitive deterioration and clumsiness , as well as changes in behavior . Specific neurological symptoms usually then follow , often in the form of parkinsonism ( cogwheel rigidity , bradykinesia or slowed movements and a lack of balance are the most common parkinsonian features [ 4 ] ) with or without a typical hand tremor , masked facial expressions , slurred speech , ataxia ( lack of coordination ) or dystonia ( twisting and repetitive movements of part of the body ) . Seizures and migraine appear to be more common in *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . [ 1 ] A characteristic tremor described as `` wing-beating tremor '' is encountered in many people with *$%^ *$%^ ; this is absent at rest but can be provoked by extending the arms . [ 5 ] Cognition can also be affected in *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . This comes in two , not mutually exclusive , categories : frontal lobe disorder ( may present as impulsivity , impaired judgement , promiscuity , apathy and executive dysfunction with poor planning and decision making ) and subcortical dementia ( may present as slow thinking , memory loss and executive dysfunction , without signs of aphasia , apraxia or agnosia ) . It is suggested that these cognitive involvements are related and closely linked to psychiatric manifestations of the *$%^ . [ 4 ] Psychiatric problems due to *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ may include behavioral changes , depression , anxiety and psychosis . [ 1 ] Psychiatric symptoms are commonly seen in conjunction with neurological symptoms and are rarely manifested on their own . These symptoms are often poorly defined and can sometimes be attributed to other causes . Because of this , diagnosis of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ is rarely made when only psychiatric symptoms are present . [ 4 ] Medical conditions have been linked with copper accumulation in *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ : Eyes : Kayser\u2013Fleischer rings ( KF rings ) , a pathognomonic sign , may be visible in the cornea of the eyes , either directly or on slit lamp examination as deposits of copper in a ring around the cornea . They are due to copper deposition in Descemet *$%^ membrane . They do not occur in all people with *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ is also associated with sunflower cataracts exhibited by brown or green pigmentation of the anterior and posterior lens capsule . [ 6 ] Neither cause significant visual loss . [ 1 ] KF rings occur in approximately 66 % of diagnosed cases ( more often in those with neurological symptoms rather than with liver problems ) . [ 3 ] Kidneys : renal tubular acidosis , a disorder of bicarbonate handling by the proximal tubules leads to nephrocalcinosis ( calcium accumulation in the kidneys ) , a weakening of bones ( due to calcium and phosphate loss ) , and occasionally aminoaciduria ( loss of essential amino acids needed for protein synthesis ) . [ 1 ] Heart : cardiomyopathy ( weakness of the heart muscle ) is a rare but recognized problem in *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ ; it may lead to heart failure ( fluid accumulation due to decreased pump function ) and cardiac arrhythmias ( episodes of irregular and/or abnormally fast or slow heart beat ) . [ 1 ] Hormones : hypoparathyroidism ( failure of the parathyroid glands leading to low calcium levels ) , infertility , and habitual abortion . [ 1 ]", "Wilson's disease"], ["The most common symptoms of COPD are sputum production , shortness of breath , and a productive cough . [ 10 ] These symptoms are present for a prolonged period of time [ 2 ] and typically worsen over time . [ 4 ] It is unclear if different types of COPD exist . [ 3 ] While previously divided into emphysema and *$%^ bronchitis , emphysema is only a description of lung changes rather than a *$%^ itself , and *$%^ bronchitis is simply a descriptor of symptoms that may or may not occur with COPD . [ 1 ] A *$%^ cough is often the first symptom to develop . When it persists for more than three months per year for at least two years , in combination with sputum production and without another explanation , there is by definition *$%^ bronchitis . This condition can occur before COPD fully develops . The amount of sputum produced can change over hours to days . In some cases the cough may not be present or may only occur occasionally and may not be productive . Some people with COPD attribute the symptoms to a `` smoker 's cough '' . Sputum may be swallowed or spat out , depending often on social and cultural factors . Vigorous coughing may lead to rib fractures or a brief loss of consciousness . Those with COPD often have a history of `` common colds '' that last a long time . [ 10 ] Shortness of breath is often the symptom that bothers people the most . [ 11 ] It is commonly described as : `` my breathing requires effort , '' `` I feel out of breath , '' or `` I ca n't get enough air in '' . [ 12 ] Different terms , however , may be used in different cultures . [ 10 ] Typically the shortness of breath is worse on exertion of a prolonged duration and worsens over time . [ 10 ] In the advanced stages it occurs during rest and may be always present . [ 13 ] [ 14 ] It is a source of both anxiety and a poor quality of life in those with COPD . [ 10 ] Many people with more advanced COPD breathe through pursed lips and this action can improve shortness of breath in some . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] In COPD , it may take longer to breathe out than to breathe in . [ 17 ] Chest tightness may occur [ 10 ] but is not common and may be caused by another problem . [ 11 ] Those with obstructed airflow may have wheezing or decreased sounds with air entry on examination of the chest with a stethoscope . [ 17 ] A barrel chest is a characteristic sign of COPD , but is relatively uncommon . [ 17 ] Tripod positioning may occur as the *$%^ worsens . [ 2 ] Advanced COPD leads to high pressure on the lung arteries , which strains the right ventricle of the heart . [ 4 ] [ 18 ] [ 19 ] This situation is referred to as cor pulmonale , and leads to symptoms of leg swelling [ 10 ] and bulging neck veins . [ 4 ] COPD is more common than any other lung *$%^ as a cause of cor pulmonale . [ 18 ] Cor pulmonale has become less common since the use of supplemental oxygen . [ 2 ] COPD often occurs along with a number of other conditions , due in part to shared risk factors . [ 3 ] These conditions include ischemic heart *$%^ , high blood pressure , diabetes mellitus , muscle wasting , osteoporosis , lung cancer , anxiety disorder and depression . [ 3 ] In those with severe *$%^ a feeling of always being tired is common . [ 10 ] Fingernail clubbing is not specific to COPD and should prompt investigations for an underlying lung cancer . [ 20 ] An acute exacerbation of COPD is defined as increased shortness of breath , increased sputum production , a change in the color of the sputum from clear to green or yellow , or an increase in cough in someone with COPD . [ 17 ] This may present with signs of increased work of breathing such as fast breathing , a fast heart rate , sweating , active use of muscles in the neck , a bluish tinge to the skin , and confusion or combative behavior in very severe exacerbations . [ 17 ] [ 21 ] Crackles may also be heard over the lungs on examination with a stethoscope . [ 22 ]", "Chronic Obstructive Pulmonary Disease"], ["Severe *$%^ *$%^ leads to the characteristic symptoms of pale , loose , and greasy stool ( steatorrhoea ) and weight loss or failure to gain weight ( in young children ) . People with milder *$%^ *$%^ may have symptoms that are much more subtle and occur in organs other than the bowel itself . It is also possible to have *$%^ *$%^ without any symptoms whatsoever . [ 3 ] Many adults with subtle *$%^ only have fatigue or anaemia . [ 4 ] The diarrhea that is characteristic of *$%^ *$%^ is ( chronic ) pale , voluminous , and abnormally malodorous . Abdominal pain and cramping , bloatedness with abdominal distension ( thought to be due to fermentative production of bowel gas ) , and mouth ulcers [ 8 ] may be present . As the bowel becomes more damaged , a degree of lactose intolerance may develop . [ 3 ] Frequently , the symptoms are ascribed to irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , only later to be recognised as *$%^ *$%^ ; a small proportion of people with symptoms of IBS have underlying *$%^ *$%^ , and screening for *$%^ *$%^ is recommended for those with IBS symptoms . [ 9 ] *$%^ *$%^ leads to an increased risk of both adenocarcinoma and lymphoma of the small bowel ( enteropathy-associated T-cell lymphoma ( EATL ) or other non-Hodgkin 's lymphomas ) . [ 10 ] This risk is also higher in first-degree relatives such as siblings , parents , and children . Whether or not a gluten-free diet brings this risk back to baseline is not clear . [ 11 ] Long-standing and untreated *$%^ may lead to other complications , such as ulcerative jejunitis ( ulcer formation of the small bowel ) and stricturing ( narrowing as a result of scarring with obstruction of the bowel ) . [ 12 ] The changes in the bowel make it less able to absorb nutrients , minerals , and the fat-soluble vitamins A , D , E , and K. [ 3 ] [ 13 ] The inability to absorb carbohydrates and fats may cause weight loss ( or failure to thrive/stunted growth in children ) and fatigue or lack of energy . Anaemia may develop in several ways : iron malabsorption may cause iron deficiency anaemia , and folic acid and vitamin B12 malabsorption may give rise to megaloblastic anaemia . Calcium and vitamin D malabsorption ( and compensatory secondary hyperparathyroidism ) may cause osteopenia ( decreased mineral content of the bone ) or osteoporosis ( bone weakening and risk of fragility fractures ) . Selenium malabsorption in *$%^ *$%^ , combined with low selenium content in many gluten-free foods , confers a risk of selenium deficiency , [ 14 ] Copper and zinc deficiencies have also been associated with *$%^ *$%^ . [ 14 ] A small proportion have abnormal coagulation due to vitamin K deficiency and are slightly at risk for abnormal bleeding . *$%^ *$%^ has been linked with a number of conditions . In many cases , it is unclear whether the gluten-induced bowel *$%^ is a causative factor or whether these conditions share a common predisposition . IgA deficiency is present in 2.3 % of people with *$%^ *$%^ , and in turn this condition features a tenfold increased risk of *$%^ *$%^ . Other features of this condition are an increased risk of infections and autoimmune *$%^ . [ 15 ] Dermatitis herpetiformis , an itchy cutaneous condition , has been linked to a transglutaminase enzyme in the skin , features small-bowel changes identical to those in *$%^ *$%^ , and may respond to gluten withdrawal even if no gastrointestinal symptoms are present . [ 16 ] [ 17 ] Growth failure and/or pubertal delay in later childhood can occur even without obvious bowel symptoms or severe malnutrition . Evaluation of growth failure often includes *$%^ screening . [ 3 ] Pregnancy complications can occur in case of *$%^ *$%^ as an intercurrent *$%^ in pregnancy , with significant complications including miscarriage , intrauterine growth restriction , low birthweight and preterm birth . [ 18 ] Hyposplenism ( a small and underactive spleen ) [ 19 ] occurs in about a third of cases and may predispose to infection given the role of the spleen in protecting against bacteria . [ 3 ] Abnormal liver function tests ( randomly detected on blood tests ) may be seen . [ 3 ] *$%^ *$%^ is associated with a number of other medical conditions , many of which are autoimmune disorders : diabetes mellitus type 1 , hypothyroidism , primary biliary cirrhosis , and microscopic colitis . [ 20 ] A more controversial area is a group of diseases in which antigliadin antibodies ( an older and nonspecific test for *$%^ *$%^ ) are sometimes detected but no small bowel *$%^ can be demonstrated . Sometimes these conditions improve by removing gluten from the diet . This includes cerebellar ataxia , peripheral neuropathy , schizophrenia , and autism . [ 21 ]", "Celiac disease"], ["Signs and symptoms of a *$%^ *$%^ can include one or more of the following : abdominal pain , classically epigastric strongly correlated to mealtimes . In case of duodenal ulcers the pain appears about three hours after taking a meal ; bloating and abdominal fullness ; waterbrash ( rush of saliva after an episode of regurgitation to dilute the acid in esophagus - although this is more associated with gastroesophageal reflux disease ) ; nausea , and copious vomiting ; loss of appetite and weight loss ; hematemesis ( vomiting of blood ) ; this can occur due to bleeding directly from a gastric *$%^ , or from damage to the esophagus from severe/continuing vomiting . melena ( tarry , foul-smelling feces due to presence of oxidized iron from hemoglobin ) ; rarely , an *$%^ can lead to a gastric or duodenal perforation , which leads to acute peritonitis , extreme , stabbing pain , [ 11 ] and requires immediate surgery . A history of heartburn , gastroesophageal reflux disease ( GERD ) and use of certain forms of medication can raise the suspicion for *$%^ *$%^ . Medicines associated with *$%^ *$%^ include NSAIDs ( non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs ) that inhibit cyclooxygenase , and most glucocorticoids ( e.g . dexamethasone and prednisolone ) . In patients over 45 with more than two weeks of the above symptoms , the odds for *$%^ ulceration are high enough to warrant rapid investigation by esophagogastroduodenoscopy . The timing of the symptoms in relation to the meal may differentiate between gastric and duodenal ulcers : A gastric *$%^ would give epigastric pain during the meal , as gastric acid production is increased as food enters the stomach . Symptoms of duodenal ulcers would initially be relieved by a meal , as the pyloric sphincter closes to concentrate the stomach contents , therefore acid is not reaching the duodenum . Duodenal *$%^ pain would manifest mostly 2\u20133 hours after the meal , when the stomach begins to release digested food and acid into the duodenum . Also , the symptoms of *$%^ ulcers may vary with the location of the *$%^ and the patient 's age . Furthermore , typical ulcers tend to heal and recur and as a result the pain may occur for few days and weeks and then wane or disappear . [ 12 ] Usually , children and the elderly do not develop any symptoms unless complications have arisen . Burning or gnawing feeling in the stomach area lasting between 30 minutes and 3 hours commonly accompanies ulcers . This pain can be misinterpreted as hunger , indigestion or heartburn . Pain is usually caused by the *$%^ but it may be aggravated by the stomach acid when it comes into contact with the ulcerated area . The pain caused by *$%^ ulcers can be felt anywhere from the navel up to the sternum , it may last from few minutes to several hours and it may be worse when the stomach is empty . Also , sometimes the pain may flare at night and it can commonly be temporarily relieved by eating foods that buffer stomach acid or by taking anti-acid medication . [ 13 ] However , *$%^ *$%^ disease symptoms may be different for every sufferer . [ 14 ] Gastrointestinal bleeding is the most common complication . Sudden large bleeding can be life-threatening . [ 15 ] It occurs when the *$%^ erodes one of the blood vessels , such as the gastroduodenal artery . Perforation ( a hole in the wall of the gastrointestinal tract ) often leads to catastrophic consequences if left untreated . Erosion of the gastro-intestinal wall by the *$%^ leads to spillage of stomach or intestinal content into the abdominal cavity . Perforation at the anterior surface of the stomach leads to acute peritonitis , initially chemical and later bacterial peritonitis . The first sign is often sudden intense abdominal pain ; an example is Valentino 's syndrome , named after the silent-film actor who experienced this pain before his death . Posterior wall perforation leads to bleeding due to involvement of gastroduodenal artery that lies posterior to the 1st part of duodenum . Penetration is a form of perforation in which the hole leads to and the *$%^ continues into adjacent organs such as the liver and pancreas . [ 12 ] Gastric outlet obstruction is the narrowing of pyloric canal by scarring and swelling of gastric antrum and duodenum due to *$%^ ulcers . Patient often presents with severe vomiting without bile . Cancer is included in the differential diagnosis ( elucidated by biopsy ) , Helicobacter pylori as the etiological factor making it 3 to 6 times more likely to develop stomach cancer from the *$%^ . [ 12 ]", "Peptic ulcer"], ["Features that result from high level of GH or expanding tumor include : Soft tissue swelling visibly resulting in enlargement of the hands , feet , nose , lips and ears , and a general thickening of the skin Soft tissue swelling of internal organs , notably the heart with attendant weakening of its muscularity , and the kidneys , also the vocal cords resulting in a characteristic thick , deep voice and slowing of speech Generalized expansion of the skull at the fontanelle Pronounced brow protrusion , often with ocular distension ( frontal bossing ) Pronounced lower jaw protrusion ( prognathism ) with attendant macroglossia ( enlargement of the tongue ) and teeth spacing Hypertrichosis , hyperpigmentation and hyperhidrosis may occur in these patients .

These symptoms can also be used to monitor the activity of the tumor after surgery , although biochemical monitoring is confirmatory .", "Acromegaly"], ["*$%^ is usually confined to one or two sites , [ 2 ] but can involve multiple sites . The scalp is the most common pulling site , followed by the eyebrows , eyelashes , face , arms , and legs . [ 4 ] Some less common areas include the pubic area , underarms , beard , and chest . [ 6 ] The classic presentation is the `` Friar Tuck '' form of vertex and crown alopecia . [ 7 ] Children are less likely to pull from areas other than the scalp . [ 4 ] People who suffer from *$%^ often pull only one hair at a time and these hair-pulling episodes can last for hours at a time . *$%^ can go into remission-like states where the individual may not experience the urge to `` pull '' for days , weeks , months , and even years . [ 8 ] Individuals with *$%^ exhibit hair of differing lengths ; some are broken hairs with blunt ends , some new growth with tapered ends , some broken mid-shaft , or some uneven stubble . Scaling on the scalp is not present , overall hair density is normal , and a hair pull test is negative ( the hair does not pull out easily ) . Hair is often pulled out leaving an unusual shape . Individuals with *$%^ may be secretive or shameful of the hair pulling behavior . [ 4 ] An additional psychological effect can be low self-esteem , often associated with being shunned by peers and the fear of socializing due to appearance and negative attention they may receive . Some people with *$%^ wear hats , wigs , false eyelashes , eyebrow pencil , or style their hair in an effort to avoid such attention . [ 1 ] There seems to be a strong stress-related component . In low-stress environments , some exhibit no symptoms ( known as `` pulling '' ) whatsoever . This `` pulling '' often resumes upon leaving this environment . [ 9 ] Some individuals with *$%^ may feel they are the only person with this problem due to low rates of reporting . [ 10 ] Other medical complications include infection , permanent loss of hair , repetitive stress injury , carpal tunnel syndrome , and gastrointestinal obstruction as a result of trichophagia . [ 2 ] In trichophagia , people with *$%^ also ingest the hair that they pull ; in extreme ( and rare ) cases this can lead to a hair ball ( trichobezoar ) . [ 4 ] Rapunzel syndrome , an extreme form of trichobezoar in which the `` tail '' of the hair ball extends into the intestines , can be fatal if misdiagnosed . [ 4 ] [ 11 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] Environment is a large factor which affects hair pulling . [ 5 ] Sedentary activities such as being in a relaxed environment are conducive to hair pulling . [ 5 ] [ 14 ] A common example of a sedentary activity promoting hair pulling is lying in a bed while trying to rest or fall asleep . [ 5 ] An extreme example of automatic *$%^ is found when some patients have been observed to pull their hair out while asleep . [ 5 ] This is called sleep-isolated *$%^ . [ 15 ]", "Trichotillomania"], ["Initially , abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , and last fever have been described and have been considered as the classic presentation of acute *$%^ . Since the innervation of the appendix enters the spinal cord at the same level as the umbilicus ( belly button ) , the abdominal pain becomes so intense and unbearable . As the appendix becomes more swollen and inflamed , it begins to irritate the adjoining abdominal wall . This leads to the localization of the pain to the right lower quadrant . This classic migration of pain may not be seen in children under three years . This pain can be elicited through various signs and can be severe . Signs include localized findings in the right iliac fossa . The abdominal wall becomes very sensitive to gentle pressure ( palpation ) . Also , there is severe pain on sudden release of deep pressure in the lower abdomen ( rebound tenderness ) . If the appendix is retrocecal ( localized behind the cecum ) , even deep pressure in the right lower quadrant may fail to elicit tenderness ( silent appendix ) . This is because the cecum , distended with gas , protects the inflamed appendix from pressure . Similarly , if the appendix lies entirely within the pelvis , there is usually complete absence of abdominal rigidity . In such cases , a digital rectal examination elicits tenderness in the rectovesical pouch . Coughing causes point tenderness in this area ( McBurney 's point ) .", "Appendicitis"], ["*$%^ *$%^ infection causes acute symptoms in 15 % of cases . [ 11 ] Symptoms are generally mild and vague , including a decreased appetite , fatigue , nausea , muscle or joint pains , and weight loss [ 12 ] and rarely does acute liver failure result . [ 13 ] Most cases of acute infection are not associated with jaundice . [ 14 ] The infection resolves spontaneously in 10\u201350 % of cases , which occurs more frequently in individuals who are young and female . [ 14 ] About 80 % of those exposed to the virus develop a chronic infection . [ 15 ] This is defined as the presence of detectable viral replication for at least six months . Most experience minimal or no symptoms during the initial few decades of the infection . [ 16 ] Chronic *$%^ *$%^ can be associated with fatigue [ 17 ] and mild cognitive problems . [ 18 ] Chronic infection after several years may cause cirrhosis or liver cancer . [ 9 ] The liver enzymes are normal in 7\u201353 % . [ 19 ] Late relapses after apparent cure have been reported , but these can be difficult to distinguish from reinfection . [ 19 ] Fatty changes to the liver occur in about half of those infected and are usually present before cirrhosis develops . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Usually ( 80 % of the time ) this change affects less than a third of the liver . [ 20 ] Worldwide *$%^ *$%^ is the cause of 27 % of cirrhosis cases and 25 % of hepatocellular carcinoma . [ 22 ] About 10\u201330 % of those infected develop cirrhosis over 30 years . [ 9 ] [ 12 ] Cirrhosis is more common in those also infected with *$%^ B , schistosoma , or HIV , in alcoholics and in those of male gender . [ 12 ] In those with *$%^ *$%^ , excess alcohol increases the risk of developing cirrhosis 100-fold . [ 23 ] Those who develop cirrhosis have a 20-fold greater risk of hepatocellular carcinoma . This transformation occurs at a rate of 1\u20133 % per year . [ 9 ] [ 12 ] Being infected with *$%^ B in addition to *$%^ *$%^ increases this risk further . [ 24 ] Liver cirrhosis may lead to portal hypertension , ascites ( accumulation of fluid in the abdomen ) , easy bruising or bleeding , varices ( enlarged veins , especially in the stomach and esophagus ) , jaundice , and a syndrome of cognitive impairment known as hepatic encephalopathy . [ 25 ] Ascites occurs at some stage in more than half of those who have a chronic infection . [ 26 ] The most common problem due to *$%^ *$%^ but not involving the liver is mixed cryoglobulinemia ( usually the type II form ) \u2014 an inflammation of small and medium-sized blood vessels . [ 27 ] [ 28 ] *$%^ *$%^ is also associated with the autoimmune disorder Sj\u00f6gren 's syndrome , a low platelet count , lichen planus , porphyria cutanea tarda , necrolytic acral erythema , insulin resistance , diabetes mellitus , diabetic nephropathy , autoimmune thyroiditis , and B-cell lymphoproliferative disorders . [ 29 ] [ 30 ] 20\u201330 % of people infected have rheumatoid factor \u2014 a type of antibody . [ 31 ] Possible associations include Hyde 's prurigo nodularis [ 32 ] and membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis . [ 17 ] Cardiomyopathy with associated abnormal heart rhythms has also been reported . [ 33 ] A variety of central nervous system disorders has been reported . [ 34 ] Chronic infection seems to be associated with an increased risk of pancreatic cancer . [ 35 ] Persons who have been infected with *$%^ *$%^ may appear to clear the virus but remain infected . [ 36 ] The virus is not detectable with conventional testing but can be found with ultra-sensitive tests . [ 37 ] The original method of detection was by demonstrating the viral genome within liver biopsies , but newer methods include an antibody test for the virus ' core protein and the detection of the viral genome after first concentrating the viral particles by ultracentrifugation . [ 38 ] A form of infection with persistently moderately elevated serum liver enzymes but without antibodies to *$%^ *$%^ has also been reported . [ 39 ] This form is known as cryptogenic occult infection . Several clinical pictures have been associated with this type of infection . [ 40 ] It may be found in people with anti-hepatitis-C antibodies but with normal serum levels of liver enzymes ; in antibody-negative people with ongoing elevated liver enzymes of unknown cause ; in healthy populations without evidence of liver disease ; and in groups at risk for HCV infection including those on hemodialysis or family members of people with occult HCV . The clinical relevance of this form of infection is under investigation . [ 41 ] The consequences of occult infection appear to be less severe than with chronic infection but can vary from minimal to hepatocellular carcinoma . [ 38 ] The rate of occult infection in those apparently cured is controversial but appears to be low . [ 19 ] 40 % of those with *$%^ but with both negative *$%^ *$%^ serology and the absence of detectable viral genome in the serum have *$%^ *$%^ virus in the liver on biopsy . [ 42 ] How commonly this occurs in children is unknown . [ 43 ]", "Hepatitis C"], ["*$%^ typically presents many different symptoms over minutes or hours [ 4 ] [ 5 ] with an average onset of 5 to 30 minutes if exposure is intravenous and 2 hours if from eating food . [ 6 ] The most common areas affected include : skin ( 80\u201390 % ) , respiratory ( 70 % ) , gastrointestinal ( 30\u201345 % ) , heart and vasculature ( 10\u201345 % ) , and central nervous system ( 10\u201315 % ) [ 5 ] with usually two or more being involved . [ 3 ] Symptoms typically include generalized hives , itchiness , flushing , or swelling ( angioedema ) of the afflicted tissues . [ 1 ] Those with angioedema may describe a burning sensation of the skin rather than itchiness . [ 6 ] Swelling of the tongue or throat occurs in up to about 20 % of cases . [ 7 ] Other features may include a runny nose and swelling of the conjunctiva . [ 8 ] The skin may also be blue tinged because of lack of oxygen . [ 8 ] Respiratory symptoms and signs that may be present include shortness of breath , wheezes , or stridor . [ 1 ] The wheezing is typically caused by spasms of the bronchial muscles [ 9 ] while stridor is related to upper airway obstruction secondary to swelling . [ 8 ] Hoarseness , pain with swallowing , or a cough may also occur . [ 6 ] Coronary artery spasm may occur with subsequent myocardial infarction , dysrhythmia , or cardiac arrest . [ 3 ] [ 5 ] Those with underlying coronary disease are at greater risk of cardiac effects from *$%^ . [ 9 ] The coronary spasm is related to the presence of histamine-releasing cells in the heart . [ 9 ] While a fast heart rate caused by low blood pressure is more common , [ 8 ] a Bezold\u2013Jarisch reflex has been described in 10 % of cases where a slow heart rate is associated with low blood pressure . [ 10 ] A drop in blood pressure or shock ( either distributive or cardiogenic ) may cause the feeling of lightheadedness or loss of consciousness . [ 9 ] Rarely very low blood pressure may be the only sign of *$%^ . [ 7 ] Gastrointestinal symptoms may include crampy abdominal pain , diarrhea , and vomiting . [ 1 ] There may be confusion , a loss of bladder control or pelvic pain similar to that of uterine cramps . [ 1 ] [ 8 ] Dilation of blood vessels around the brain may cause headaches . [ 6 ] A feeling of anxiety or of `` impending doom '' has also been described . [ 3 ]", "Anaphylaxis"], ["*$%^ is rarely accompanied by any symptoms , and its identification is usually through screening , or when seeking healthcare for an unrelated problem . Some with high blood pressure report headaches ( particularly at the back of the head and in the morning ) , as well as lightheadedness , vertigo , tinnitus ( buzzing or hissing in the ears ) , altered vision or fainting episodes . [ 8 ] These symptoms , however , might be related to associated anxiety rather than the high blood pressure itself . [ 9 ] On physical examination , *$%^ may be associated with the presence of changes in the optic fundus seen by ophthalmoscopy . [ 10 ] The severity of the changes typical of hypertensive retinopathy is graded from I\u2013IV ; grades I and II may be difficult to differentiate . [ 10 ] The severity of the retinopathy correlates roughly with the duration and/or the severity of the *$%^ . [ 8 ] *$%^ with certain specific additional signs and symptoms may suggest secondary *$%^ , i.e . *$%^ due to an identifiable cause . For example , Cushing 's syndrome frequently causes truncal obesity , glucose intolerance , moon face , a hump of fat behind the neck/shoulder , and purple abdominal stretch marks . [ 11 ] Hyperthyroidism frequently causes weight loss with increased appetite , fast heart rate , bulging eyes , and tremor . Renal artery stenosis ( RAS ) may be associated with a localized abdominal bruit to the left or right of the midline ( unilateral RAS ) , or in both locations ( bilateral RAS ) . Coarctation of the aorta frequently causes a decreased blood pressure in the lower extremities relative to the arms , and/or delayed or absent femoral arterial pulses . . Pheochromocytoma may cause abrupt ( `` paroxysmal '' ) episodes of *$%^ accompanied by headache , palpitations , pale appearance , and excessive sweating . [ 11 ] Severely elevated blood pressure ( equal to or greater than a systolic 180 or diastolic of 110 ) is referred to as a hypertensive crisis . Hypertensive crisis is categorized as either hypertensive urgency or hypertensive emergency , according to the presence or absence of end organ damage . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In hypertensive urgency , there is no evidence of end organ damage resulting from the elevated blood pressure . In these cases , oral medications are used to lower the BP gradually over 24 to 48 hours . [ 14 ] In hypertensive emergency , there is evidence of direct damage to one or more organs . [ 15 ] The most affected organs include the brain , kidney , heart and lungs , producing symptoms which may include confusion , drowsiness , chest pain and breathlessness . [ 14 ] In hypertensive emergency , the blood pressure must be reduced rapidly to stop ongoing organ damage . [ 14 ] *$%^ occurs in approximately 8\u201310 % of pregnancies . [ 11 ] Two blood pressure measurements six hours apart of greater than 140/90 mm Hg is considered diagnostic of *$%^ in pregnancy . [ 16 ] High blood pressure in pregnancy can be classified as pre-existing *$%^ , gestational *$%^ or pre-eclampsia . [ 17 ] Pre-eclampsia is a serious condition of the second half of pregnancy and following delivery characterised by increased blood pressure and the presence of protein in the urine . [ 11 ] It occurs in about 5 % of pregnancies and is responsible for approximately 16 % of all maternal deaths globally . [ 11 ] Pre-eclampsia also doubles the risk of perinatal mortality . [ 11 ] Usually there are no symptoms in pre-eclampsia and it is detected by routine screening . When symptoms of pre-eclampsia occur the most common are headache , visual disturbance ( often `` flashing lights '' ) , vomiting , pain over the stomach , and swelling . Pre-eclampsia can occasionally progress to a life-threatening condition called eclampsia , which is a hypertensive emergency and has several serious complications including vision loss , brain swelling , seizures , kidney failure , pulmonary edema , and disseminated intravascular coagulation ( a blood clotting disorder ) . [ 11 ] [ 18 ] In contrast , gestational *$%^ is defined as new-onset *$%^ during pregnancy without protein in the urine . [ 17 ] Failure to thrive , seizures , irritability , lack of energy , and difficulty breathing [ 19 ] can be associated with *$%^ in neonates and young infants . In older infants and children , *$%^ can cause headache , unexplained irritability , fatigue , failure to thrive , blurred vision , nosebleeds , and facial paralysis . [ 19 ] [ 20 ]", "Hypertension"], ["These are acute intermittent *$%^ , variegate *$%^ , hereditary coproporphyria and ALA dehydratase ( also known as porphobilinogen synthase ) *$%^ . The acute porphyrias primarily affect the nervous system , resulting in episodic crises known as acute attacks . The major symptom of the acute attack is abdominal pain , often accompanied by vomiting , hypertension ( elevated blood pressure ) and tachycardia . The most severe episodes may develop neurological complications : typically a motor neuropathy ( severe dysfunction of the peripheral nerves which innervate muscle ) , leading to muscle weakness and potentially to quadriplegia ( paralysis of all four limbs ) , as well as central nervous system ( brain and spinal cord ) symptoms including seizures and coma . Occasionally there may be short-lived , acute psychiatric symptoms such as anxiety , confusion , hallucinations , and very rarely , overt psychosis . All these symptoms resolve once the acute attack passes . *$%^ is not a cause of chronic psychiatric illness , though an association with anxiety and depression has been suggested . [ citation needed ] Given the many presentations and the relatively low occurrence of *$%^ , the patient may initially be suspected to have other , unrelated conditions . For instance , the polyneuropathy of acute *$%^ may be mistaken for Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome , and *$%^ testing is commonly recommended in those situations . [ 5 ] These are X-linked dominant protoporphyria ( XLDPP ) , congenital erythropoietic *$%^ ( CEP ) , *$%^ cutanea tarda ( PCT ) and erythropoietic protoporphyria ( EPP ) . None of these are associated with acute attacks ; their primary manifestation is with skin disease . ( For this reason , these four porphyrias , along with two of the acute porphyrias which may also show skin manifestations - VP and HCP - are sometimes termed cutaneous porphyrias . ) Skin disease is encountered in those porphyrias where excess *$%^ accumulate in the skin . *$%^ are photoactive molecules , and exposure to light results in promotion of electrons to higher energy levels . When these return to the resting energy level or ground state , energy is released . This accounts for the property of fluorescence typical of the porphyrins . Light is absorbed at ultraviolet wavelengths center at 405 nm and reradiated at red wavelengths of approximately 630 nm . In the skin , this causes local damage . Two distinct patterns of skin disease are seen in *$%^ : - Immediate photosensitivity . This is typical of XLDPP and EPP . Following a variable period of sun-exposure - typically about 30 minutes , patients complain of severe pain , burning and discomfort in sun-exposed areas . Typically there is nothing to see , though occasionally there may be some redness and swelling of the skin . - Vesiculo-erosive skin disease . This term refers to the characteristic blistering ( vesicles ) and open sores ( erosions ) noted in these patients . It is the pattern of skin disease seen in CEP , PCT , VP and HCP . These changes are noted only in sun-exposed areas such as the backs of the hands and face . Milder skin disease , such as that seen in VP and HCP , consists of increased skin fragility in exposed areas with a tendency to form blisters and erosions particularly after minor knocks or scrapes . These heal slowly , often leaving small scars which may be lighter or darker than normal skin . More severe skin disease is sometimes seen in PCT , with more prominent lessons , darkening of exposed skin such as the face and hypertrichosis : abnormal hair growth on the face , particularly the cheeks . The most severe disease is seen in CEP and a rare variant of PCT known as hepatoerythropoietic *$%^ ( HEP ) ; here the term photoutilation is used to describe the severe shortening of digits and loss of skin appendages such as hair and nails , and severe scarring of the skin with progressive disappearance of ears , lips and nose . These patients may also show deformed , discolored teeth , gum and eye abnormalities .", "Porphyria"], ["*$%^ goes undetected in many people , and symptoms can be minor or vague . The signs and symptoms can be related to the underlying cause or the *$%^ itself . Most commonly , people with *$%^ report feelings of weakness , or fatigue , general malaise , and sometimes poor concentration . They may also report dyspnea ( shortness of breath ) on exertion . In very severe *$%^ , the body may compensate for the lack of oxygen-carrying capability of the blood by increasing cardiac output . The patient may have symptoms related to this , such as palpitations , angina ( if pre-existing heart disease is present ) , intermittent claudication of the legs , and symptoms of heart failure . On examination , the signs exhibited may include pallor ( pale skin , lining mucosa , conjunctiva and nail beds ) , but this is not a reliable sign . There may be signs of specific causes of *$%^ , e.g. , koilonychia ( in iron deficiency ) , jaundice ( when *$%^ results from abnormal break down of red blood cells \u2014 in hemolytic *$%^ ) , bone deformities ( found in thalassemia major ) or leg ulcers ( seen in sickle-cell disease ) . In severe *$%^ , there may be signs of a hyperdynamic circulation : tachycardia ( a fast heart rate ) , bounding pulse , flow murmurs , and cardiac ventricular hypertrophy ( enlargement ) . There may be signs of heart failure . Pica , the consumption of non-food items such as ice , but also paper , wax , or grass , and even hair or dirt , may be a symptom of iron deficiency , although it occurs often in those who have normal levels of hemoglobin . Chronic *$%^ may result in behavioral disturbances in children as a direct result of impaired neurological development in infants , and reduced scholastic performance in children of school age . Restless legs syndrome is more common in those with iron-deficiency *$%^ .", "Anemia"], ["*$%^ presents with blurry distance vision , but generally gives good near vision . In high *$%^ , even near vision is affected as objects must be extremely close to the eyes to see clearly , and people with *$%^ can not read without their glasses prescribed for distance . On fundoscopic examination of the eye , the optic nerve appears to be tilted and an area of white sclera could be seen on next to the disc with a line of hyperpigmentation separating this area from normal retina . The macula will have some retinal pigmentary changes and sometimes will have subretinal hemorrhages . The retina in myopic patients is thin and thorough evaluation of the periphery might show retinal holes and lattice degeneration . In addition , people with *$%^ might develop choroidal neovascularization in the macula .", "Myopia"], ["Most people infected with trichomonas vaginalis do not have any symptoms . [ 2 ] Symptoms experienced include pain , burning or itching in the penis , urethra ( urethritis ) , or vagina ( vaginitis ) . Discomfort for both sexes may increase during intercourse and urination . For women there may also be a yellow-green , itchy , frothy , foul-smelling ( `` fishy '' smell ) vaginal discharge . In rare cases , lower abdominal pain can occur . Symptoms usually appear within 5 to 28 days of exposure .

Peeling from the palms and around the fingers occurs about a week later . '' Peeling also occurs in the axilla , the groin , and the tips of fingers and toes [ 1 ] The rash is the most striking sign of *$%^ *$%^ . It usually appears first on the neck and face ( often leaving a clear , unaffected area around the mouth ) . It looks like a bad sunburn with tiny bumps , and it may itch . It then spreads to the chest and back and finally to the rest of the body . In the body creases , especially around the underarms and elbows , the rash forms the classic red streaks known as Pastia 's lines . On very dark skin , the streaks may appear darker than the rest of the skin . Areas of rash usually turn white ( or paler brown , with dark complexioned skin ) when pressed on . By the sixth day of the infection , the rash usually fades , but the affected skin may begin to peel . Usually , other symptoms help to confirm a diagnosis of *$%^ *$%^ , including a reddened and sore throat , a *$%^ at or above 101 \u00b0F ( 38.3 \u00b0C ) , and swollen glands in the neck . *$%^ *$%^ can also occur with a low *$%^ . The tonsils and back of the throat may have a whitish coating , or appear red , swollen , and dotted with whitish or yellowish specks of pus . Early in the infection , the tongue may have a whitish or yellowish coating . Also , an infected person may have chills , body aches , nausea , vomiting , and loss of appetite . In rare cases , *$%^ *$%^ may develop from a streptococcal skin infection like impetigo . In these cases , the person may not develop soreness of the throat . When *$%^ *$%^ occurs because of a throat infection , the *$%^ typically subsides within 3 to 5 days , and the sore throat passes soon afterward . The scarlet-fever rash usually fades on the sixth day after sore-throat symptoms started , and begins to peel ( as described above ) . The infection itself is usually cured with a 10-day course of antibiotics , but it may take a few weeks for tonsils and swollen glands to return to normal .", "Scarlet fever"], ["It is primarily caused by Staphylococcus aureus , and sometimes by Streptococcus pyogenes . [ 6 ] Both bullous and nonbullous are primarily caused by S. aureus , with Streptococcus also commonly being involved in the nonbullous form . [ 7 ] The infection is spread by direct contact with lesions or with nasal carriers . The incubation period is 1\u20133 days after exposure to Streptococcus and 4\u201310 days for Staphylococcus . [ 8 ] Dried streptococci in the air are not infectious to intact skin . Scratching may spread the lesions .", "Impetigo"], ["One third of individuals with pinworm infection are totally asymptomatic . [ 5 ] The main symptoms are pruritus ani and perineal pruritus , i.e. , itching in and around the anus and around the perineum . [ 5 ] [ 7 ] [ 8 ] The itching occurs mainly during the night , [ 7 ] [ 9 ] and is caused by the female pinworms migrating to lay eggs around the anus . [ 4 ] [ 8 ] Both the migrating females and the clumps of eggs are irritating , but the mechanisms causing the intense pruritus have not been explained . [ 9 ] The intensity of the itching varies , and it can be described as tickling , crawling sensations , or even acute pain . [ 10 ] The itching leads to continuously scratching the area around the anus , which can further result in tearing of the skin and complications such as secondary bacterial infections , including bacterial dermatitis ( i.e. , skin inflammation ) and folliculitis ( i.e. , hair follicle inflammation ) . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] [ 10 ] General symptoms are insomnia ( i.e. , persistent difficulties to sleep ) and restlessness . [ 7 ] A considerable proportion of children suffer from loss of appetite , weight loss , irritability , emotional instability , and enuresis ( i.e. , inability to control urination ) . [ 7 ] Pinworms can not damage the skin , [ 11 ] and they do not normally migrate through tissues . [ 8 ] However , in women they may move onto the vulva and into the vagina , from there moving to external orifice of the uterus , and onwards to the uterine cavity , fallopian tubes , ovaries , and peritoneal cavity . [ 11 ] This can cause vulvovaginitis , i.e . an inflammation of the vulva and vagina . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] This causes vaginal discharge and pruritus vulvae , i.e. , itchiness of the vulva . [ 7 ] The pinworms can also enter the urethra , and presumably , they carry intestinal bacteria with them . [ 11 ] According to Gutierrez ( 2000 ) , a statistically significant correlation between pinworm infection and urinary tract infections has been shown , [ 11 ] however Burkhart & Burkhart ( 2005 ) maintain that the incidence of pinworms as a cause of urinary tract infections remains unknown . [ 5 ] Incidentally , one report indicated that 36 % of young girls with urinary tract infection also had pinworms . [ 5 ] Dysuria ( i.e. , painful urination ) has been associated with pinworm infection . [ 5 ] The relationship between pinworm infestation and appendicitis has been researched , but there is a lack of clear consensus in the matter : while Gutierres ( 2005 ) maintains that there exists a consensus that pinworms do not produce the inflammatory reaction , [ 12 ] Cook ( 1994 ) states that it is controversial whether pinworms are causatively related to acute appendicitis , [ 10 ] and Burkhart & Burkhart ( 2004 ) state that pinworm infection causes symptoms of appendicitis to surface . [ 5 ]", "Enterobiasis"], ["*$%^ vulgaris ( also known as chronic stationary *$%^ or plaque-like *$%^ ) is the most common form and affects 85 % \u201390 % of people with *$%^ . [ 7 ] Plaque *$%^ typically appears as raised areas of inflamed skin covered with silvery-white scaly skin . These areas are called plaques and are most commonly found on the elbows , knees , scalp , and back . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Psoriatic erythroderma ( erythrodermic *$%^ ) involves widespread inflammation and exfoliation of the skin over most of the body surface . It may be accompanied by severe itching , swelling , and pain . It is often the result of an exacerbation of unstable plaque *$%^ , particularly following the abrupt withdrawal of systemic glucocorticoids . [ 9 ] This form of *$%^ can be fatal as the extreme inflammation and exfoliation disrupt the body 's ability to regulate temperature and perform barrier functions . [ 10 ] Plaques of *$%^ Plaques of *$%^ A person 's arm covered with plaque *$%^ A person 's arm covered with plaque *$%^ *$%^ of the palms *$%^ of the palms Pustular *$%^ appears as raised bumps filled with noninfectious pus ( pustules ) . [ 11 ] The skin under and surrounding the pustules is red and tender . [ 12 ] Pustular *$%^ can be localized , commonly to the hands and feet ( palmoplantar pustulosis ) , or generalized with widespread patches occurring randomly on any part of the body . Acrodermatitis continua is a form of localized *$%^ limited to the fingers and toes that may spread to the hands and feet . [ 12 ] Pustulosis palmaris et plantaris is another form of localized pustular *$%^ similar to acrodermatitis continua with pustules erupting from red , tender , scaly skin found on the palms of the hands and the soles of the feet . [ 12 ] Generalized pustular *$%^ ( pustular *$%^ of von Zumbusch ) , also known as impetigo herpetiformis during pregnancy , [ 13 ] is a rare and severe form of *$%^ that may require hospitalization . The development of generalized pustular *$%^ is often caused by an infection , abrupt withdrawal of topical corticosteroid treatment , pregnancy , hypocalcemia , medications , or following an irritating topical treatment for plaque *$%^ . [ 12 ] This form of *$%^ is characterized by an acute onset of numerous pustules on top of tender red skin . This skin eruption is often accompanied by a fever , muscle aches , nausea , and an elevated white blood cell count . [ 12 ] Annular pustular *$%^ ( APP ) , a rare form of generalized pustular *$%^ , is the most common type seen during childhood . [ 13 ] APP tends to occur in women more frequently than in men , and is usually less severe than other forms of generalized pustular *$%^ such as impetigo herpetiformis . [ 13 ] This form of *$%^ is characterized by ring-shaped plaques with pustules around the edges and yellow crusting . [ 13 ] APP most often affects the torso , neck , arms , and legs . [ 13 ] Additional types of *$%^ affecting the skin include inverse *$%^ , guttate *$%^ , oral *$%^ , and seborrheic-like *$%^ . [ 14 ] Inverse *$%^ ( also known as flexural *$%^ ) appears as smooth , inflamed patches of skin . The patches frequently affect skin folds , particularly around the genitals ( between the thigh and groin ) , the armpits , in the skin folds of an overweight abdomen ( known as panniculus ) , between the buttocks in the intergluteal cleft , and under the breasts in the inframammary fold . Heat , trauma , and infection are thought to play a role in the development of this atypical form of *$%^ . [ 15 ] Napkin *$%^ is a subtype of *$%^ common in infants characterized by red papules with silver scale in the diaper area that may extend to the torso or limbs . [ 16 ] Napkin *$%^ is often misdiagnosed as napkin dermatitis ( diaper rash ) . [ 17 ] Guttate *$%^ is characterized by numerous small , scaly , red or pink , droplet-like lesions ( papules ) . These numerous spots of *$%^ appear over large areas of the body , primarily the trunk , but also the limbs and scalp . Guttate *$%^ is often triggered by a streptococcal infection , typically streptococcal pharyngitis . [ 15 ] The reverse is not true . Oral *$%^ is very rare , [ 18 ] in contrast to lichen planus , another common papulosquamous disorder that commonly involves both the skin and mouth . When *$%^ involves the oral mucosa ( the lining of the mouth ) , it may be asymptomatic , [ 18 ] but it may appear as white or grey-yellow plaques . [ 18 ] Fissured tongue is the most common finding in those with oral *$%^ and has been reported to occur in 6.5\u201320 % of people with *$%^ affecting the skin . The microscopic appearance of oral mucosa affected by geographic tongue ( migratory stomatitis ) is very similar to the appearance of *$%^ . [ 19 ] However , modern studies have failed to demonstrate any link between the two conditions . [ 20 ] Seborrheic-like *$%^ is a common form of *$%^ with clinical aspects of *$%^ and seborrheic dermatitis , and may be difficult to distinguish from the latter . This form of *$%^ typically manifests as red plaques with greasy scales in areas of higher sebum production such as the scalp , forehead , skin folds next to the nose , skin surrounding the mouth , skin on the chest above the sternum , and in skin folds . [ 16 ] Psoriatic arthritis is a form of chronic inflammatory arthritis that has a highly variable clinical presentation and frequently occurs in association with skin and nail *$%^ . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] It typically involves painful inflammation of the joints and surrounding connective tissue and can occur in any joint , but most commonly affects the joints of the fingers and toes . This can result in a sausage-shaped swelling of the fingers and toes known as dactylitis . [ 21 ] Psoriatic arthritis can also affect the hips , knees , spine ( spondylitis ) , and sacroiliac joint ( sacroiliitis ) . [ 23 ] About 30 % of individuals with *$%^ will develop psoriatic arthritis . [ 7 ] Skin manifestations of *$%^ tend to occur before arthritic manifestations in about 75 % of cases . [ 22 ] *$%^ can affect the nails and produces a variety of changes in the appearance of finger and toe nails . Nail *$%^ occurs in 40\u201345 % of people with *$%^ affecting the skin and has a lifetime incidence of 80\u201390 % in those with psoriatic arthritis . [ 24 ] These changes include pitting of the nails ( pinhead-sized depressions in the nail is seen in 70 % with nail *$%^ ) , whitening of the nail , small areas of bleeding from capillaries under the nail , yellow-reddish discoloration of the nails known as the oil drop or salmon spot , thickening of the skin under the nail ( subungual hyperkeratosis ) , loosening and separation of the nail ( onycholysis ) , and crumbling of the nail . [ 24 ] In addition to the appearance and distribution of the rash , specific medical signs may be used by medical practitioners to assist with diagnosis . These may include Auspitz 's sign ( pinpoint bleeding when scale is removed ) , Koebner phenomenon ( psoriatic skin lesions induced by trauma to the skin ) , [ 16 ] and itching and pain localized to papules and plaques . [ 15 ] [ 16 ]", "Psoriasis"], ["When *$%^ begins , it invariably produces no symptoms . Signs and symptoms only appear as the mass continues to grow or ulcerates . The findings that result depend on the type and location of the *$%^ . Few symptoms are specific , with many of them also frequently occurring in individuals who have other conditions . *$%^ is the new `` great imitator '' . Thus , it is not uncommon for people diagnosed with *$%^ to have been treated for other diseases , which were assumed to be causing their symptoms . [ 26 ] Local symptoms may occur due to the mass of the tumor or its ulceration . For example , mass effects from lung *$%^ can cause blockage of the bronchus resulting in cough or pneumonia ; esophageal *$%^ can cause narrowing of the esophagus , making it difficult or painful to swallow ; and colorectal *$%^ may lead to narrowing or blockages in the bowel , resulting in changes in bowel habits . Masses in breasts or testicles may be easily felt . Ulceration can cause bleeding that , if it occurs in the lung , will lead to coughing up blood , in the bowels to anemia or rectal bleeding , in the bladder to blood in the urine , and in the uterus to vaginal bleeding . Although localized pain may occur in advanced *$%^ , the initial swelling is usually painless . Some cancers can cause a buildup of fluid within the chest or abdomen . [ 26 ] General symptoms occur due to distant effects of the *$%^ that are not related to direct or metastatic spread . These may include : unintentional weight loss , fever , being excessively tired , and changes to the skin . [ 27 ] Hodgkin disease , leukemias , and cancers of the liver or kidney can cause a persistent fever of unknown origin . [ 26 ] Some cancers may cause specific groups of systemic symptoms , termed paraneoplastic phenomena . Examples include the appearance of myasthenia gravis in thymoma and clubbing in lung *$%^ . [ 26 ] *$%^ can spread from its original site by local spread , lymphatic spread to regional lymph nodes or by blood ( haematogenous spread ) to distant sites , known as metastasis . When *$%^ spreads by a haematogenous route , it usually spreads all over the body . However , *$%^ 'seeds ' grow in certain selected site only ( 'soil ' ) as hypothesized in the soil and seed hypothesis of *$%^ metastasis . The symptoms of metastatic cancers depend on the location of the tumor , and can include enlarged lymph nodes ( which can be felt or sometimes seen under the skin and are typically hard ) , enlarged liver or enlarged spleen , which can be felt in the abdomen , pain or fracture of affected bones , and neurological symptoms . [ 26 ]", "Cancer"], ["People having reached skeletal maturity are less likely to have a worsening case . Some severe cases of *$%^ can lead to diminishing lung capacity , putting pressure on the heart , and restricting physical activities .

Later symptoms that can be present are pain in the anterior region of the neck and changes in voice due to an involvement of the recurrent laryngeal nerve . *$%^ *$%^ is usually found in a euthyroid patient , but symptoms of hyperthyroidism or hypothyroidism may be associated with a large or metastatic well-differentiated tumor . *$%^ nodules are of particular concern when they are found in those under the age of 20 . The presentation of benign nodules at this age is less likely , and thus the potential for malignancy is far greater .", "Thyroid cancer"], ["Signs and symptoms vary depending on the degree of *$%^ , and may be divided by the three stages of severity . Infants with *$%^ may feel cold when touched , with bright red skin and unusual lack of energy . [ 12 ] Symptoms of mild *$%^ may be vague , [ 13 ] with sympathetic nervous system excitation ( shivering , high blood pressure , fast heart rate , fast respiratory rate , and contraction of blood vessels ) . These are all physiological responses to preserve heat . [ 14 ] Increased urine production due to cold , mental confusion , and hepatic dysfunction may also be present . [ 15 ] Hyperglycemia may be present , as glucose consumption by cells and insulin secretion both decrease , and tissue sensitivity to insulin may be blunted . [ 16 ] Sympathetic activation also releases glucose from the liver . In many cases , however , especially in alcoholic patients , hypoglycemia appears to be a more common presentation . [ 16 ] Hypoglycemia is also found in many hypothermic patients , because *$%^ may be a result of hypoglycemia . [ 17 ] Low body temperature results in shivering becoming more violent . Muscle mis-coordination becomes apparent . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] [ 20 ] Movements are slow and labored , accompanied by a stumbling pace and mild confusion , although the person may appear alert . Surface blood vessels contract further as the body focuses its remaining resources on keeping the vital organs warm . The subject becomes pale . Lips , ears , fingers , and toes may become blue . As the temperature decreases , further physiological systems falter and heart rate , respiratory rate , and blood pressure all decrease . This results in an expected heart rate in the 30s at a temperature of 28 \u00b0C ( 82 \u00b0F ) . [ 15 ] Difficulty speaking , sluggish thinking , and amnesia start to appear ; inability to use hands and stumbling are also usually present . Cellular metabolic processes shut down . Below 30 \u00b0C ( 86 \u00b0F ) , the exposed skin becomes blue and puffy , muscle coordination very poor , and walking almost impossible , and the person exhibits incoherent/irrational behavior , including terminal burrowing ( see below ) or even stupor . Pulse and respiration rates decrease significantly , but fast heart rates ( ventricular tachycardia , atrial fibrillation ) can also occur . Atrial fibrillation is not typically a concern in and of itself . [ 2 ] Major organs fail . Clinical death occurs . Twenty to fifty percent of *$%^ deaths are associated with paradoxical undressing . This typically occurs during moderate to severe *$%^ , as the person becomes disoriented , confused , and combative . They may begin discarding their clothing , which , in turn , increases the rate of heat loss . [ 21 ] [ 22 ] Rescuers who are trained in mountain survival techniques are taught to expect this ; however , some may assume incorrectly that urban victims of *$%^ have been subjected to a sexual assault . [ 23 ] One explanation for the effect is a cold-induced malfunction of the hypothalamus , the part of the brain that regulates body temperature . Another explanation is that the muscles contracting peripheral blood vessels become exhausted ( known as a loss of vasomotor tone ) and relax , leading to a sudden surge of blood ( and heat ) to the extremities , fooling the person into feeling overheated . [ 23 ] [ 24 ] An apparent self-protective behaviour known as terminal burrowing , or hide-and-die syndrome , [ 25 ] occurs in the final stages of *$%^ . The afflicted will enter small , enclosed spaces , such as underneath beds or behind wardrobes . It is often associated with paradoxical undressing . [ 26 ] Researchers in Germany claim this is `` obviously an autonomous process of the brain stem , which is triggered in the final state of *$%^ and produces a primitive and burrowing-like behavior of protection , as seen in hibernating animals . `` [ 27 ] This happens mostly in cases where temperature drops slowly . [ 24 ]", "Hypothermia"], ["*$%^ *$%^ *$%^ may be characterized by the following signs and symptoms : Splitting ( thinking in extremes ) Chaos in relationships Markedly disturbed sense of identity Intense or uncontrollable emotional outbursts Unstable interpersonal relationships and self-esteem Concerns about abandonment Self-damaging behavior Impulsivity Frequently accompanied by depression , anxiety , anger , substance abuse , or rage The most distinguishing symptoms of BPD are marked sensitivity to rejection , negative criticism , and thoughts and fears of possible abandonment . [ 11 ] Overall , the features of BPD include unusually intense sensitivity in relationships with others , difficulty regulating emotions , and impulsivity . Other symptoms may include feeling unsure of one 's personal identity , morals , and values , having paranoid thoughts when feeling stressed , and severe dissociation . [ 11 ] Persons with BPD feel emotions more easily , more deeply , and longer than others do . [ 12 ] [ 13 ] In addition , emotions may repeatedly resurge and persist a long time . [ 13 ] Consequently , it may take longer than normal for people with BPD to return to a stable emotional baseline following an intense emotional experience . [ 14 ] In Marsha Linehan 's view , the sensitivity , intensity , and duration with which people with BPD feel emotions have both positive and negative effects . [ 14 ] People with BPD are often exceptionally enthusiastic , idealistic , joyful , and loving . [ 15 ] However , they may feel overwhelmed by negative emotions ( `` anxiety , depression , guilt/shame , worry , anger , etc . `` [ 1 ] ) , experiencing intense grief instead of sadness , shame , and humiliation instead of mild embarrassment , rage instead of annoyance , and panic instead of nervousness . [ 15 ] People with BPD are also especially sensitive to feelings of rejection , criticism , isolation , and perceived failure . [ 16 ] Before learning other coping mechanisms , their efforts to manage or escape from their very negative emotions may lead to self-injury or suicidal behavior . [ 17 ] They are often aware of the intensity of their negative emotional reactions and , since they can not regulate them , they shut them down entirely . [ 14 ] This can be harmful to people with BPD , since negative emotions alert people to the presence of a problematic situation and move them to address it . [ 14 ] While people with BPD feel joy intensely , they are especially prone to dysphoria , depression , and/or feelings of mental and emotional distress . Zanarini et al . recognized four categories of dysphoria that are typical of this condition : extreme emotions , destructiveness or self-destructiveness , feeling fragmented or lacking identity , and feelings of victimization . [ 18 ] Within these categories , a BPD diagnosis is strongly associated with a combination of three specific states : feeling betrayed , `` feeling like hurting myself '' , and feeling out of control . [ 18 ] Since there is great variety in the types of dysphoria experienced by people with BPD , the amplitude of the distress is a helpful indicator of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . [ 18 ] In addition to intense emotions , people with BPD experience emotional lability ; or in other words , changeability . Although the term emotional lability suggests rapid changes between depression and elation , the mood swings in people with this condition actually fluctuate more frequently between anger and anxiety and between depression and anxiety . [ 19 ] Impulsive behavior is common , including substance or alcohol abuse , eating disorders , unprotected sex or indiscriminate sex with multiple partners , reckless spending , and reckless driving . [ 20 ] Impulsive behavior may also include leaving jobs or relationships , running away , and self-injury . [ 21 ] People with BPD act impulsively because it gives them immediate relief from their emotional pain . [ 21 ] However , in the long term , people with BPD suffer increased pain from the shame and guilt that follow such actions . [ 21 ] A cycle often begins in which people with BPD feel emotional pain , engage in impulsive behavior to relieve that pain , feel shame and guilt over their actions , feel emotional pain from the shame and guilt , and then experience stronger urges to engage in impulsive behavior to relieve the new pain . [ 21 ] As time goes on , impulsive behavior may become an automatic response to emotional pain . [ 21 ] Self-harming or suicidal behavior is one of the core diagnostic criteria in the DSM IV-TR . Management of and recovery from this behavior can be complex and challenging . [ 22 ] The lifetime risk of suicide among people with BPD is between 3 % and 10 % . [ 11 ] [ 23 ] There is evidence that men diagnosed with BPD are approximately twice as likely to complete suicide as women diagnosed with BPD . [ 24 ] There is also evidence that a considerable percentage of men who complete suicide may have undiagnosed BPD . [ 25 ] Self-injury is common and may take place with or without suicidal intent . [ 26 ] [ 27 ] The reported reasons for non-suicidal self-injury ( NSSI ) differ from the reasons for suicide attempts . [ 17 ] Reasons for NSSI include expressing anger , self-punishment , generating normal feelings ( often in response to dissociation ) , and distracting oneself from emotional pain or difficult circumstances . [ 17 ] In contrast , suicide attempts typically reflect a belief that others will be better off following the suicide . [ 17 ] Both suicidal and non-suicidal self-injury are a response to feeling negative emotions . [ 17 ] Sexual abuse can be a particular trigger for suicidal behavior in adolescents with BPD tendencies . [ 28 ] [ quantify ] People with BPD can be very sensitive to the way others treat them , by feeling intense joy and gratitude at perceived expressions of kindness , and intense sadness or anger at perceived criticism or hurtfulness . [ 29 ] Their feelings about others often shift from admiration or love to anger or dislike after a disappointment , a perceived threat of losing someone , or a perceived loss of esteem in the eyes of someone they value . This phenomenon , sometimes called splitting or black-and-white thinking , includes a shift from idealizing others to devaluing them . [ 30 ] Combined with mood disturbances , idealization and devaluation can undermine relationships with family , friends , and co-workers . [ 31 ] Self-image can also change rapidly from healthy to unhealthy . While strongly desiring intimacy , people with BPD tend toward insecure , avoidant or ambivalent , or fearfully preoccupied attachment patterns in relationships , [ 32 ] and they often view the world as dangerous and malevolent . [ 29 ] BPD , like other *$%^ disorders , is linked to increased levels of chronic stress and conflict in romantic relationships , decreased satisfaction on the part of romantic partners , abuse , and unwanted pregnancy . [ 33 ] People with BPD tend to have trouble seeing a clear picture of their identity . In particular , they tend to have difficulty knowing what they value , believe , prefer , and enjoy . [ 34 ] They are often unsure about their long-term goals for relationships and jobs . This difficulty with knowing who they are and what they value can cause people with BPD to experience feeling `` empty '' and `` lost '' . [ 34 ] The often intense emotions experienced by people with BPD can make it difficult for them to control the focus of their attention\u2014to concentrate . [ 34 ] In addition , people with BPD may tend to dissociate , which can be thought of as an intense form of `` zoning out '' . [ 35 ] Dissociation often occurs in response to experiencing a painful event ( or experiencing something that triggers the memory of a painful event ) . It involves the mind automatically redirecting attention away from that event , presumably to protect against experiencing intense emotion and unwanted behavioral impulses that such emotion might otherwise trigger . [ 35 ] Although the mind 's habit of blocking out intense painful emotions may provide temporary relief , it can also have the unwanted side effect of blocking or blunting the experience of ordinary emotions , reducing the access of people with BPD to the information contained in those emotions , which helps guide effective decision-making in daily life . [ 35 ] Sometimes , it is possible for another person to tell when someone with BPD is dissociating , because their facial or vocal expressions may become flat or expressionless , or they may appear to be distracted ; at other times , dissociation may be barely noticeable . [ 35 ]", "Borderline personality disorder"], ["Genetic testing for *$%^ *$%^ is clinically available and may help confirm a diagnosis as well as differentiate between relatives who are at risk for the disease and those who are not . Some symptoms when pinpointing this disease include fainting , irregular heartbeats , and chaotic heartbeats . However , just detecting the irregular heartbeat may be a sign of another disease so the doctor must detect another symptom as well . [ 14 ] In some cases , the disease can be detected by observing characteristic patterns on an electrocardiogram , which may be present all the time or might be elicited by the administration of particular drugs ( e.g. , Class IA ( ajmaline , procainamide ) or class 1C ( flecainide , pilsicainide ) antiarrhythmic drugs that block sodium channels and cause appearance of ECG abnormalities ) or resurface spontaneously due to as yet unclarified triggers . *$%^ *$%^ has three different ECG patterns . [ 15 ] Type 1 has a coved type ST elevation with at least 2 mm ( 0.2 mV ) J-point elevation a gradually descending ST segment followed by a negative T-wave . Type 2 has a saddle back pattern with a least 2 mm J-point elevation and at least 1 mm ST elevation with a positive or biphasic T-wave . Type 2 pattern can occasionally be seen in healthy subjects . Type 3 has either a coved ( type 1 like ) or a saddle back ( type 2 like ) pattern with less than 2 mm J-point elevation and less than 1 mm ST elevation . Type 3 pattern is not rare in healthy subjects . The pattern seen on the ECG is persistent ST elevations in the electrocardiographic leads V1-V3 with a right bundle branch block ( RBBB ) appearance with or without the terminal S waves in the lateral leads that are associated with a typical RBBB . A prolongation of the PR interval ( a conduction disturbance in the heart ) is also frequently seen . The ECG can fluctuate over time , depending on the autonomic balance and the administration of antiarrhythmic drugs . Adrenergic stimulation decreases the ST segment elevation , while vagal stimulation worsens it . ( There is a case report of a patient who died while shaving , presumed due to the vagal stimulation of the carotid sinus massage . ) The administration of class Ia , Ic and III drugs increases the ST segment elevation , as does fever . [ 16 ] Exercise decreases ST segment elevation in some patients but increases it in others ( after exercise when the body temperature has risen ) . The changes in heart rate induced by atrial pacing are accompanied by changes in the degree of ST segment elevation . When the heart rate decreases , the ST segment elevation increases and when the heart rate increases the ST segment elevation decreases . However , the contrary can also be observed .", "Brugada syndrome"], ["Acute infection with *$%^ *$%^ virus is associated with acute viral *$%^ \u2013 an illness that begins with general ill-health , loss of appetite , nausea , vomiting , body aches , mild fever , and dark urine , and then progresses to development of jaundice . It has been noted that itchy skin has been an indication as a possible symptom of all *$%^ virus types . The illness lasts for a few weeks and then gradually improves in most affected people . A few people may have more severe liver disease ( fulminant hepatic failure ) , and may die as a result . The infection may be entirely asymptomatic and may go unrecognized .

[ 15 ] The cough from *$%^ has been documented to cause subconjunctival hemorrhages , rib fractures , urinary incontinence , hernias , and vertebral artery dissection . [ 15 ] Violent coughing can cause the pleura to rupture , leading to a pneumothorax .

After one to two weeks , the coughing classically develops into uncontrollable fits , each with five to ten forceful coughs , followed by a high-pitched `` whoop '' sound in younger children , or a gasping sound in older children , as the person tries to inhale ( paroxysmal stage ) . Fits can occur on their own or can be triggered by yawning , stretching , laughing , eating , or yelling ; they usually occur in groups , with multiple episodes on an hourly basis throughout the day . This stage usually lasts two to eight weeks , or sometimes longer . A gradual transition then occurs to the convalescent stage , which usually lasts one to two weeks .

[ 6 ] [ 8 ] Internal *$%^ are usually only painful if they become thrombosed or necrotic . [ 2 ]", "Hemorrhoids"], ["The disorder causes muscle weakness and atrophy throughout the body due to the degeneration of the upper and lower motor neurons . Individuals affected by the disorder may ultimately lose the ability to initiate and control all voluntary movement , although bladder and bowel function and the muscles responsible for eye movement are usually spared until the final stages of the disorder . [ 14 ] Cognitive function is generally spared for most people , although some ( about 5 % ) also develop frontotemporal dementia . [ 15 ] A higher proportion of people ( 30\u201350 % ) also have more subtle cognitive changes which may go unnoticed , but are revealed by detailed neuropsychological testing . Sometimes , ALS coexists in individuals who also experience dementia , degenerative muscle disorder , and degenerative bone disorder as part of a syndrome called multisystem proteinopathy . [ 16 ] Sensory nerves and the autonomic nervous system are generally unaffected , meaning the majority of people with ALS maintain hearing , sight , touch , smell , and taste . [ 17 ] The start of ALS may be so subtle that the symptoms are overlooked . [ 18 ] The earliest symptoms of ALS are muscle weakness and/or muscle atrophy . Other presenting symptoms include trouble swallowing or breathing , cramping , or stiffness of affected muscles ; muscle weakness affecting an arm or a leg ; and/or slurred and nasal speech . The parts of the body affected by early symptoms of ALS depend on which motor neurons in the body are damaged first . About 75 % of people contracting the disorder first experience weakness or atrophy in an arm or leg and this is known as `` limb-onset '' ALS . Awkwardness when walking or running or even tripping over or stumbling may be experienced and often this is marked by walking with a `` dropped foot '' which drags gently on the ground . Or if arm-onset , difficulty with tasks requiring manual dexterity such as buttoning a shirt , writing , or turning a key in a lock may be experienced . Occasionally , the symptoms remain confined to one limb for a long period of time or for the duration of the illness ; this is known as monomelic amyotrophy . About 25 % of cases begin as progressive bulbar palsy termed `` bulbar-onset '' ALS . Initial symptoms will mainly be of difficulty speaking clearly or swallowing . Speech may become slurred , nasal in character , or quieter . There may be difficulty in swallowing and loss of tongue mobility . A smaller proportion of people experience `` respiratory-onset '' ALS , where the intercostal muscles that support breathing are affected first . A small proportion of people may also present with what appears to be frontotemporal dementia , but later progresses to include more typical ALS symptoms . Over time , people experience increasing difficulty moving , swallowing ( dysphagia ) , and speaking or forming words ( dysarthria ) . Symptoms of upper motor neuron involvement include tight and stiff muscles ( spasticity ) and exaggerated reflexes ( hyperreflexia ) including an overactive gag reflex . An abnormal reflex commonly called Babinski 's sign also indicates upper motor neuron damage . Symptoms of lower motor neuron degeneration include muscle weakness and atrophy , muscle cramps , and fleeting twitches of muscles that can be seen under the skin ( fasciculations ) although twitching is not a diagnostic symptom and more of a side effect so twitching would either occur after or accompany weakness and atrophy . Around 15\u201345 % of people experience pseudobulbar affect , a neurological disorder also known as `` emotional lability '' , which consists of uncontrollable laughter , crying , or smiling , attributable to degeneration of bulbar upper motor neurons , resulting in exaggeration of motor expressions of emotion . [ citation needed ] For ALS to be diagnosed , symptoms of both upper and lower motor neuron damage that can not be attributed to other causes must be present . Although the order and rate of symptoms varies from person to person , most people eventually are not able to walk or use their hands and arms . They also lose the ability to speak and swallow food , while most end up on a portable ventilator , called bilevel positive airway pressure . The rate of progression can be measured using an outcome measure called the `` ALS Functional Rating Scale Revised ( ALSFRS-R ) '' , a 12-item instrument administered as a clinical interview or patient-reported questionnaire that produces a score between 48 ( normal function ) and 0 ( severe disability ) . Though the degree of variability is high and a small percentage of people have a much slower disorder , on average , patients lose about 0.9 FRS points per month . A survey-based study amongst clinicians showed that they rated a 20 % change in the slope of the ALSFRS-R as being clinically meaningful . [ 19 ] Regardless of the part of the body first affected by the disorder , muscle weakness and atrophy spread to other parts of the body as the disorder progresses . In limb-onset ALS , symptoms usually spread from the affected limb to the opposite limb before affecting a new body region , whereas in bulbar-onset ALS , symptoms typically spread to the arms before the legs . Disorder progression tends to be slower in patients who are younger than 40 at onset , [ 20 ] [ 21 ] are mildly obese , [ 22 ] have disorder restricted primarily to one limb , and those with primarily upper motor neuron symptoms . [ 23 ] Conversely , progression is faster and prognosis poorer in people with bulbar-onset disorder , respiratory-onset disorder , and frontotemporal dementia . [ 23 ] The CX3CR1 allelic variants have also been shown to have an effect on the disorder 's progression and life expectancy . [ 24 ] Although respiratory support can ease problems with breathing and prolong survival , it does not affect the progression of ALS . Most people with ALS die from respiratory failure , usually within three to five years from the onset of symptoms . The median survival time from onset to death is around 39 months , and only 4 % survive longer than 10 years . [ 25 ] Guitarist Jason Becker has lived since 1989 with the disorder , while physicist Stephen Hawking has survived for more than 50 years , but they are considered unusual cases . [ 26 ] Difficulty in chewing and swallowing makes eating very difficult and increases the risk of choking or of aspirating food into the lungs . In later stages of the disorder , aspiration pneumonia can develop , and maintaining a healthy weight can become a significant problem that may require the insertion of a feeding tube . As the diaphragm and intercostal muscles of the rib cage that support breathing weaken , measures of lung function such as vital capacity and inspiratory pressure diminish . In respiratory-onset ALS , this may occur before significant limb weakness is apparent . Most people with ALS die of respiratory failure or pneumonia . In late stages , the oculomotor nerve that controls the movements of the eye can be affected as can the extraocular muscles ( EOMs ) . The eye movements remain unaffected largely until the later stages due to differences in the extraocular muscles compared to the skeletal muscles that are initially and readily affected . In the disease 's final stages , a person 's condition may resemble locked-in syndrome . [ 27 ] People with ALS may have difficulty in generating voluntary fast movements of the eye . [ 28 ] The speed of eye movement is slower in people with ALS . [ 28 ] Problems in generating smooth pursuit and convergence movements have also been noted . [ 28 ] Testing the vestibulo-ocular reflex should help in identifying these problems . [ 29 ] The electrooculography ( EOG ) technique measures the resting potential of the retina . EOG findings in people with ALS show progressive changes that correlate with disorder progression , and provide a measurement for clinically evaluating the effects of disorder progression on oculomotor activity . [ 29 ] Additionally , EOG may allow earlier detection of problems with the eyes . The embryonic lineage of EOMs differs from that of somite-derived muscles . EOMs are unique because they continuously remodel through life and maintain a population of active satellite cells during aging . [ 30 ] EOMs have significantly more myogenic precursor cells than limb skeletal muscles .

This can take the form of chronic lung infection or widespread disseminated infection ( affecting the tissues lining the brain , soft tissues , joints , and bone ) . Chronic infection is responsible for most of the morbidity and mortality . Chronic fibrocavitary disease is manifested by cough , sputum , fevers , night sweats and weight loss .

Narcissists have such an elevated sense of self-worth that they value themselves as inherently better than others , when in reality they have a fragile self-esteem , can not handle criticism , and often try to compensate for this inner fragility by belittling or disparaging others in an attempt to validate their own self-worth . Comments and criticisms about others are vicious from sufferers of NPD , in an attempt to boost their own poor self-esteem . [ 8 ] Another narcissist symptom is a lack of empathy . They are unable to relate , understand , and rationalize the feelings of others . Instead of behaving in a way that shows how they are feeling in the moment , they behave in the way that they feel they are expected to behave or that gives them the most attention . [ 5 ] An extensive US survey found a high association with other disabilities , especially amongst men : mental disability , substance use , mood , anxiety disorders and other *$%^ disorders , bipolar I *$%^ , post-traumatic stress *$%^ , and schizotypal and borderline *$%^ disorders were among the associated disabilities . [ 9 ] The study of narcissism and the *$%^ defenses in the eating disorders was concerned with the correlation between eating pathology and narcissism . Two types of narcissism were observed : core narcissism , having extremely positive ( high ) self-esteem combined with delusions about the level and ability of achievement ; and *$%^ defenses , defenses that are triggered when self-esteem is threatened . Such narcissists maintain self-esteem by seeing themselves as misunderstood and subject to intolerable demands . [ 10 ] Two types of *$%^ defenses that were measured with eating pathology were `` poisonous pedagogy '' and `` narcissistically abused '' . Poisonous pedagogy is one who places blame on others and is overly critical of others ' inadequacies . The narcissistically abused are those who put others\u2019 needs before theirs yet see themselves as being poorly treated . Two groups were measured : Clinical ( 83 women and one male with the mean age of 28.4 ) and Non-Clinical ( 70 women with a mean age of 23.2 ) . The body mass index of the groups did not significantly vary . Participants filled out a questionnaire that was measured by eating characteristic and narcissism levels by the OMNI ( O\u2019Brien Multiphasic Narcissism Inventory ) and the EDE-Q ( Eating *$%^ Examination Questionnaire ) . OMNI measures pathological narcissism of *$%^ *$%^ , poisonous pedagogy , and narcissistically abused *$%^ . EDE-Q measures the common eating disorders : restraint , eating concern , body shape concern , and body weight concern . [ 10 ] The basic summaries of the questionnaire\u2019s findings were that the poisonous pedagogy defenses was related to restrictive mind-set ; the narcissistically abused defense related to restraint , eating concern , body shape concern , and body weight concern . The only main difference between the groups was the role of core narcissism in the clinical women\u2019s levels of eating concerns . The authors concluded that further research is needed to better understand the relationship approaches in both groups . [ 10 ] In 2005 , Board and Fritzon published the results of a study in which they interviewed senior business managers , assessing them for the presence of *$%^ *$%^ . [ 11 ] Comparing their findings to three samples of psychiatric patients , they found that their senior business managers were as likely to demonstrate *$%^ traits as the patient population , although were less physically aggressive .", "Narcissistic personality disorder"], ["The main symptoms of *$%^ are dysphagia ( difficulty in swallowing ) , regurgitation of undigested food , chest pain behind the sternum , and weight loss . [ 8 ] Dysphagia tends to become progressively worse over time and to involve both fluids and solids . Some people may also experience coughing when lying in a horizontal position . The chest pain experienced , also known as cardiospasm and non-cardiac chest pain can often be mistaken for a heart attack . It can be extremely painful in some sufferers . Food and liquid , including saliva , are retained in the esophagus and may be inhaled into the lungs ( aspiration ) .", "Achalasia"], ["Symptoms related to *$%^ *$%^ depend on the degree of *$%^ . Most people with mild to moderate *$%^ *$%^ do not have symptoms . Symptoms usually present in individuals with severe *$%^ *$%^ , though they may occur in those with mild to moderate *$%^ *$%^ as well . The three main symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ are loss of consciousness , anginal chest pain and shortness of breath with activity or other symptoms of heart failure such as shortness of breath while lying flat , episodes of shortness of breath at night , or swollen legs and feet . [ 3 ] [ 6 ] It may also be accompanied by the characteristic `` Dresden china '' appearance of pallor with a light flush . [ 7 ] Angina in setting of heart failure also increases the risk of death . In people with angina , the 5 year mortality rate is 50 % if the *$%^ valve is not replaced . Angina in the setting of AS occurs due to left ventricular hypertrophy ( LVH ) that is caused by the constant production of increased pressure required to overcome the pressure gradient caused by the AS . While the muscular layer of the left ventricle thickens , the arteries that supply the muscle do not get significantly longer or bigger , so the muscle may not receive enough blood supply to meet its oxygen requirement . This ischemia may first be evident during exercise , when the heart muscle requires increased blood supply to compensate for the increased workload . The individual may complain of anginal chest pain with exertion . At this stage , a cardiac stress test with imaging may be suggestive of ischemia . Eventually , however , the heart muscle will require more blood supply at rest than can be supplied by the coronary artery branches . At this point there may be signs of ventricular strain pattern ( ST segment depression and T wave inversion ) on the EKG , suggesting subendocardial ischemia . The subendocardium is the region that is most susceptible to ischemia because it is the most distant from the epicardial coronary arteries . Syncope ( fainting spells ) from *$%^ valve *$%^ is usually exertional . [ 3 ] [ 8 ] In the setting of heart failure it increases the risk of death . In people with syncope , the 3 year mortality rate is 50 % , if the *$%^ valve is not replaced . [ citation needed ] It is unclear why *$%^ *$%^ causes syncope . One popular theory is that severe AS produces a nearly fixed cardiac output . [ 9 ] When a person with *$%^ *$%^ exercises , their peripheral vascular resistance will decrease as the blood vessels of the skeletal muscles dilate to allow the muscles to receive more blood to allow them to do more work . This decrease in peripheral vascular resistance is normally compensated for by an increase in the cardiac output . Since people with severe AS can not increase their cardiac output , the blood pressure falls and the person will faint due to decreased blood perfusion to the brain . A second theory as to why syncope may occur in AS is that during exercise , the high pressures generated in the hypertrophied left ventricle cause a vasodepressor response , which causes a secondary peripheral vasodilation that , in turn , causes decreased blood flow to the brain resulting in loss of consciousness . Indeed , in *$%^ *$%^ , because of the fixed obstruction to bloodflow out from the heart , it may be impossible for the heart to increase its output to offset peripheral vasodilation . A third mechanism may sometimes be operative . Due to the hypertrophy of the left ventricle in *$%^ *$%^ , including the consequent inability of the coronary arteries to adequately supply blood to the myocardium ( see `` Angina '' below ) , abnormal heart rhythms may develop . These can lead to syncope . Finally , in calcific *$%^ *$%^ [ 10 ] [ 11 ] at least , the calcification in and around the *$%^ valve can progress and extend to involve the electrical conduction system of the heart . If that occurs , the result may be heart block - a potentially lethal condition of which syncope may be a symptom . Congestive heart failure ( CHF ) carries a grave prognosis in people with AS . People with CHF attributable to AS have a 2-year mortality rate of 50 % if the *$%^ valve is not replaced . [ citation needed ] CHF in the setting of AS is due to a combination of left ventricular hypertrophy with fibrosis , systolic dysfunction ( a decrease in the ejection fraction ) and diastolic dysfunction ( elevated filling pressure of the LV ) . [ 3 ] In Heyde 's syndrome , *$%^ *$%^ is associated with gastrointestinal bleeding due to angiodysplasia of the colon . [ 12 ] Recent research has shown that the *$%^ causes a form of von Willebrand disease by breaking down its associated coagulation factor ( factor VIII-associated antigen , also called von Willebrand factor ) , due to increased turbulence around the stenosed valve . Notwithstanding the foregoing , the American Heart Association has recently changed its recommendations regarding antibiotic prophylaxis for endocarditis . Specifically , as of 2007 , it is recommended that such prophylaxis be limited only to those with prosthetic heart valves , those with previous episode ( s ) of endocarditis , and those with certain types of congenital heart disease . [ citation needed ] Since the stenosed *$%^ valve may limit the heart 's output , people with *$%^ *$%^ are at risk of syncope and dangerously low blood pressure should they use any of a number of medications for cardiovascular diseases that often coexist with *$%^ *$%^ . Examples include nitroglycerin , nitrates , ACE inhibitors , terazosin ( Hytrin ) , and hydralazine . Note that all of these substances lead to peripheral vasodilation . Under normal circumstances , in the absence of *$%^ *$%^ , the heart is able to increase its output and thereby offset the effect of the dilated blood vessels . In some cases of *$%^ *$%^ , however , due to the obstruction of blood flow out of the heart caused by the stenosed *$%^ valve , cardiac output can not be increased . Low blood pressure or syncope may ensue .", "Aortic stenosis"], ["The most-common symptoms of GERD in adults are heartburn [ 6 ] and regurgitation . Less-common symptoms include pain with swallowing/sore throat , increased salivation ( also known as water brash ) , nausea , [ 7 ] chest pain , and coughing . GERD sometimes causes injury of the esophagus . These injuries may include one or more of the following : *$%^ esophagitis \u2013 necrosis of esophageal epithelium causing ulcers near the junction of the stomach and esophagus Esophageal strictures \u2013 the persistent narrowing of the esophagus caused by reflux-induced inflammation Barrett 's esophagus \u2013 intestinal metaplasia ( changes of the epithelial cells from squamous to intestinal columnar epithelium ) of the distal esophagus [ 8 ] Esophageal adenocarcinoma \u2013 a rare form of cancer [ 7 ] Some people [ who ? ] have proposed that symptoms such as sinusitis , recurrent ear infections , and idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis are due to GERD ; however , a causative role has not been established . [ 7 ] [ not in citation given ] GERD may be difficult to detect in infants and children , since they can not describe what they are feeling and indicators must be observed . Symptoms may vary from typical adult symptoms . GERD in children may cause repeated vomiting , effortless spitting up , coughing , and other respiratory problems , such as wheezing . Inconsolable crying , refusing food , crying for food and then pulling off the bottle or breast only to cry for it again , failure to gain adequate weight , bad breath , and belching or burping are also common . Children may have one symptom or many ; no single symptom is universal in all children with GERD . Of the estimated 4 million babies born in the US each year , up to 35 % of them may have difficulties with *$%^ in the first few months of their lives , known as 'spitting up ' . [ 9 ] One theory for this is the `` fourth trimester theory '' which notes most animals are born with significant mobility , but humans are relatively helpless at birth , and suggests there may have once been a fourth trimester , but children began to be born earlier , evolutionarily , to accommodate the development of larger heads and brains and allow them to pass through the birth canal and this leaves them with partially undeveloped digestive systems . Most children will outgrow their *$%^ by their first birthday . However , a small but significant number of them will not outgrow the condition . This is particularly true when a family history of GERD is present . GERD may lead to Barrett 's esophagus , a type of intestinal metaplasia , [ 8 ] which is in turn a precursor condition for esophageal cancer . The risk of progression from Barrett 's to dysplasia is uncertain , but is estimated at about 20 % of cases . [ 10 ] Due to the risk of chronic heartburn progressing to Barrett 's , EGD every five years is recommended for people with chronic heartburn , or who take drugs for chronic GERD .

[ 12 ]", "Dementia with Lewy bodies"], ["People with SPD are often aloof , cold and indifferent , which causes interpersonal difficulty . Most individuals diagnosed with SPD have trouble establishing personal relationships or expressing their feelings meaningfully . They may remain passive in the face of unfavorable situations . Their communication with other people may be indifferent and terse at times . Because of their lack of meaningful communication with other people , those who are diagnosed with SPD are not able to develop accurate impressions of how well they get along with others . [ 3 ] Such images are believed to be important for a person 's self-awareness and ability to assess the impact of their own actions in social situations . R.D . Laing suggests that when one is not enriched by injections of interpersonal reality , the self-image becomes increasingly empty and volatilized , which leads the individual to feel unreal . [ 3 ] When the individual 's personal space is violated , they feel suffocated and feel the need to free themselves and be independent . People who have SPD tend to be happiest when they are in a relationship in which the partner places few emotional or intimate demands on them . It is not people as such that they want to avoid , but emotions both negative and positive , emotional intimacy , and self disclosure . [ 4 ] [ full citation needed ] This means that it is possible for *$%^ individuals to form relationships with others based on intellectual , physical , familial , occupational , or recreational activities as long as these modes of relating do not require or force the need for emotional intimacy , which the affected individual will reject . Donald Winnicott explains this need to modulate emotional interaction by saying that *$%^ individuals `` prefer to make relationships on their own terms and not in terms of the impulses of other people . '' Failing to attain that , they prefer isolation . [ 5 ] [ full citation needed ] Many fundamentally *$%^ individuals display an engaging , interactive *$%^ that contradicts the observable characteristic emphasized by the DSM-IV and ICD-10 definitions of the *$%^ *$%^ . [ 6 ] [ full citation needed ] Klein classifies these individuals as `` secret schizoids '' , [ 6 ] who present themselves as socially available , interested , engaged and involved in interacting yet remain emotionally withdrawn and sequestered within the safety of the internal world . Withdrawal or detachment from the outer world is a characteristic feature of *$%^ pathology , but may appear either in `` classic '' or in `` secret '' form . When classic , it matches the typical description of the *$%^ *$%^ offered in the DSM-IV . It is however `` just as often '' a hidden internal state : that which meets the objective eye may not match the subjective , internal world of the patient . Klein therefore cautions that one should not miss identifying the *$%^ patient because one can not see the patient 's withdrawal through the patient 's defensive , compensatory interaction with external reality . He suggests that one need only ask the patient what his or her subjective experience is in order to detect the presence of the *$%^ refusal of emotional intimacy . [ 6 ] Descriptions of the *$%^ *$%^ as `` hidden '' behind an outward appearance of emotional engagement have been recognized as far back as 1940 with Fairbairn 's description of `` *$%^ exhibitionism , '' in which the *$%^ individual is able to express a great deal of feeling and to make what appear to be impressive social contacts yet in reality gives nothing and loses nothing . Because he is only `` playing a part , '' his own *$%^ is not involved . According to Fairbairn , the person disowns the part which he is playing and thus the *$%^ individual seeks to preserve his own *$%^ intact and immune from compromise . `` [ 7 ] [ full citation needed ] Further references to the secret *$%^ come from Masud Khan , [ 8 ] [ full citation needed ] Jeffrey Seinfeld [ 9 ] [ full citation needed ] and Philip Manfield , [ 10 ] [ full citation needed ] who give a palpable description of an SPD individual who actually `` enjoys '' regular public speaking engagements but experiences great difficulty in the breaks when audience members would attempt to engage him emotionally . [ 11 ] These references expose the problems involved in relying singularly on outer observable behavior for assessing the presence of *$%^ disorders in certain individuals . Whether SPD qualifies as a full *$%^ *$%^ or simply as an avoidant attachment style is contentious . [ 12 ] If what has been known as *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ is no more than an attachment style requiring more distant emotional proximity , then many of the more problematic reactions these individuals show in interpersonal situations may be partly accounted for by the social judgments commonly imposed on those with this style . Several sources to date have confirmed the synonymy of SPD and avoidant attachment style , [ 13 ] [ full citation needed ] which leaves open the question of how researchers might best approach this subject in future diagnostic manuals and therapeutic practice . However , the distinction should be made that individuals with SPD characteristically do not seek social interactions merely due to lack of interest , while those with avoidant attachment style can in fact be interested in interacting with others , but without establishing connections of much depth or length due to having little tolerance for any kind of intimacy . People with SPD are sometimes sexually apathetic , though they do not typically suffer from anorgasmia . Their preference to remain alone and detached may cause their need for sex to appear to be less than that of those who do not have SPD . Sex often causes individuals with SPD to feel that their personal space is being violated , and they commonly feel that masturbation or sexual abstinence is preferable to the emotional closeness they must tolerate when having sex . [ 14 ] [ full citation needed ] Significantly broadening this picture are notable exceptions of SPD individuals who engage in occasional or even frequent sexual activities with others . [ 15 ] Harry Guntrip [ 16 ] [ full citation needed ] describes the `` secret sexual affair '' entered into by some married *$%^ individuals as an attempt to reduce the quantity of emotional intimacy focused within a single relationship , a sentiment echoed by Karen Horney 's `` resigned *$%^ '' who may exclude sex as `` too intimate for a permanent relationship , and instead satisfy his sexual needs with a stranger . Conversely , he may more or less restrict a relationship to merely sexual contacts and not share other experiences with the partner . `` [ 17 ] [ full citation needed ] Jeffrey Seinfeld , professor of social work at New York University , has published a volume on SPD [ 18 ] [ full citation needed ] that details examples of `` *$%^ hunger '' which may manifest as sexual promiscuity . Seinfeld provides an example of a *$%^ woman who would covertly attend various bars to meet men for the purpose of gaining impersonal sexual gratification , an act which alleviated her feelings of hunger and emptiness . Salman Akhtar describes this dynamic interplay of overt versus covert sexuality and motivations of some SPD individuals with greater accuracy . Rather than following the narrow proposition that *$%^ individuals are either sexual or asexual , Akhtar suggests that these forces may both be present in an individual despite their rather contradictory aims . [ 19 ] A clinically accurate picture of *$%^ sexuality must therefore include the overt signs : `` asexual , sometimes celibate ; free of romantic interests ; averse to sexual gossip and innuendo , '' as well as possible covert manifestations of `` secret voyeuristic and pornographic interests ; vulnerable to erotomania ; tendency towards compulsive masturbation and perversions , '' [ 19 ] although none of these necessarily apply to all people with SPD .", "Schizoid personality disorder"], ["Women who perform considerable amounts of exercise on a regular basis or lose a significant amount of weight are at risk of developing hypothalamic ( or 'athletic ' ) *$%^ . Functional Hypothalamic *$%^ ( FHA ) can be caused by stress , weight loss , and/or excessive exercise . Many women who diet or who exercise at a high level do not take in enough calories to expend on their exercise as well as to maintain their normal menstrual cycles . [ 7 ] The threshold of developing *$%^ appears to be dependent on low energy availability rather than absolute weight because a critical minimum amount of stored , easily mobilized energy is necessary to maintain regular menstrual cycles . [ 8 ] Energy imbalance and weight loss can disrupt menstrual cycles through several hormonal mechanisms . Weight loss can cause elevations in the hormone ghrelin which inhibits the hypothalamic-pituitary-ovarial axis . [ 9 ] Elevated concentrations of ghrelin alter the amplitude of GnRH pulses , which causes diminished pituitary release of LH and follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) . [ 10 ] Secondary amenorrhea is caused by low levels of the hormone leptin in females with low body weight . [ 11 ] Like ghrelin , leptin signals energy balance and fat stores to the reproductive axis . [ 12 ] Decreased levels of leptin are closely related to low levels of body fat , and correlate with a slowing of GnRH pulsing . When a woman is experiencing *$%^ , an eating disorder , and osteoporosis together , this is called female athlete triad syndrome . A lack of eating causes *$%^ and bone loss leading to osteopenia and sometimes progressing to osteoporosis . [ citation needed ] The social effects of *$%^ on a person vary significantly . *$%^ is often associated with anorexia nervosa and other eating disorders , which have their own effects . If secondary *$%^ is triggered early in life , for example through excessive exercise or weight loss , menarche may not return later in life . A woman in this situation may be unable to become pregnant , even with the help of drugs . Long-term *$%^ leads to an estrogen deficiency which can bring about menopause at an early age . The hormone estrogen plays a significant role in regulating calcium loss after ages 25\u201330 . When her ovaries no longer produce estrogen because of *$%^ , a woman is more likely to suffer rapid calcium loss , which in turn can lead to osteoporosis . [ 13 ] Increased testosterone levels cause by *$%^ may lead to body hair growth and decreased breast size . [ 14 ] Increased levels of androgens , especially testosterone , can also lead to ovarian cysts . Some research among amenorrhoeic runners indicates that the loss of menses may be accompanied by a loss of self-esteem . [ 15 ] Certain medications , particularly contraceptive medications , can induce *$%^ in a healthy woman . The lack of menstruation usually begins shortly after beginning the medication and can take up to a year to resume after stopping a medication . Hormonal contraceptives that contain only progestogen like the oral contraceptive Micronor , and especially higher-dose formulations like the injectable Depo Provera commonly induce this side-effect . Extended cycle use of combined hormonal contraceptives also allow suppression of menstruation . Patients who use and then cease using contraceptives like the combined oral contraceptive pill may experience secondary *$%^ as a withdrawal symptom . [ 16 ] The link is not well understood , as studies have found no difference in hormone levels between women who develop *$%^ as a withdrawal symptom following the cessation of OCOP use and women who experience secondary *$%^ because of other reasons . [ 17 ] New contraceptive pills , like continuous oral contraceptive pills ( OCPs ) which do not have the normal 7 days of placebo pills in each cycle , have been shown to increase rates of *$%^ in women . Studies show that women are most likely to experience *$%^ after 1 year of treatment with continuous OCP use . [ 18 ] The use of opiates ( such as heroin ) on a regular basis has also been known to cause *$%^ in longer term users . [ citation needed ] Anti-psychotic drugs used to treat schizophrenia have been known to cause *$%^ as well . New research suggests that adding a dosage of Metformin to an anti-psychotic drug regimen can restore menstruation . [ 19 ] Metformin decreases resistance to the hormone insulin , as well as levels of prolactin , testosterone , and lutenizing hormone ( LH ) . Metformin also decreases the LH/FSH ratio . Results of the study on Metformin further implicate the regulation of these hormones as a main cause of secondary *$%^ . Breastfeeding is a common cause of secondary *$%^ , and often the condition lasts for over six months . [ 20 ] Breastfeeding typically lasts longer than lactational *$%^ , and the duration of *$%^ varies depending on how often a women breastfeeds . [ 21 ] Lactational *$%^ has been advocated as a method of family planning , especially in developing countries where access to other methods of contraception may be limited . Breastfeeding is said to prevent more births in the developing world than any other method of birth control or contraception . Lactational *$%^ is 98 % percent effective as a method of preventing pregnancy in the first six months postpartum . [ 22 ] *$%^ can also be caused by physical deformities . One example of this is Mayer\u2013Rokitansky\u2013K\u00fcster\u2013Hauser syndrome , the second-most common cause of primary *$%^ . [ 23 ] The syndrome is characterized by M\u00fcllerian agenesis . In MRKH Syndrome , the M\u00fcllerian ducts do not develop , which prevents menstruation . The syndrome usually develops during the first trimester of pregnancy . MRI techniques can be helpful in determining the extent of the problem . Women may recover from MRKH syndrome , but other times primary *$%^ , which is characteristic of the disorder , may prevent pregnancy for life .", "Amenorrhoea"], ["The sensations\u2014and the need to move\u2014may return immediately after ceasing movement or at a later time .

The pain can frequently be severe , worsening when food of any sort is swallowed . Another sign may be an unusually husky , raspy , or hoarse-sounding cough , a result of the tumor affecting the recurrent laryngeal nerve . The presence of the tumor may disrupt the normal contractions of the esophagus when swallowing . This can lead to nausea and vomiting , regurgitation of food and coughing .

Compression of local structures occurs in advanced disease , leading to such problems as upper airway obstruction and superior vena cava syndrome . Hypercalcemia ( excess calcium in the blood ) may occur . [ 11 ] If the *$%^ has spread elsewhere , symptoms related to metastatic disease may appear . Common sites of spread include nearby lymph nodes , the liver , lungs and bone . [ 11 ] Liver metastasis can cause jaundice and abdominal swelling ( ascites ) . Lung metastasis can cause , among other symptoms , impaired breathing due to excess fluid around the lungs ( pleural effusion ) , and dyspnea ( the feelings often associated with impaired breathing ) .", "Esophageal cancer"], ["Several experts theorize that the development of *$%^ in childhood is due to a delay in maturation . There are also high-voltage delta waves in somnambulists up to 17 years of age . This presence might suggest an immaturity in the central nervous system , also a possible cause of *$%^ . [ 4 ] Other precipitating factors to *$%^ are those factors which increase the slow wave sleep stage . [ 10 ] These most commonly include sleep deprivation , fever , and excessive tiredness . The use of some neuroleptics or hypnotics can also cause *$%^ to occur . [ 11 ] Drug and alcohol consumption has been linked to sleep walking activity . Though alcohol is a sedative , and usually puts a person to sleep , the quality of sleep they undergo is usually not ideal . Alcohol also tends to increase the number of times the sleeper wakes . Not only is the sleep quality an issue , but with alcohol and the risk of getting up and sleep walking , there is the additional problem with intoxication , which is increased clumsiness . With increased clumsiness comes increased danger for the sleep walker to fall into things or fall down stairs , etc . There are treatments for maintaining sleep quality , ideally lessening , or even more ideally , eliminating sleep walking . [ 12 ] *$%^ is clustered in families , and the percentage of childhood *$%^ increases to 45 % if one parent was affected , and 60 % if both parents were affected . However , there is no recorded preference to male or female individuals . [ 9 ] Thus , heritable factors appear to predispose an individual to develop *$%^ , but expression of the trait may also be influenced by environmental factors . [ 13 ] *$%^ may be inherited as an autosomal dominant disorder with reduced penetrance . Genome-wide multipoint parametric linkage analysis for *$%^ revealed a maximum logarithm of the odds score of 3.44 at chromosome 20q12-q13.12 between 55.6 and 61.4 cM . [ 14 ] In some cases , *$%^ in adults may be a symptom of a psychological disorder . One study suggests higher levels of dissociation in adult sleepwalkers , since test subjects scored unusually high on the hysteria portion of the `` Crown-Crisp Experiential Index '' . [ 15 ] Another suggested that `` A higher incidence [ of *$%^ events ] has been reported in patients with schizophrenia , hysteria and anxiety neuroses. '' . [ 16 ] Also , patients with migraine headaches or Tourette Syndrome are 4\u20136 times more likely to sleepwalk . Some medications that may increase *$%^ include : chlorpromazine ( Thorazine ) , perphenazine ( Trilafon ) , lithium , triazolam ( Halcion ) , amitriptyline ( Elavil , Endep ) , zolpidem ( Ambien ) , Quetiapine ( Seroquel ) and beta blockers . [ 4 ]", "Sleepwalking"], ["*$%^ *$%^ symptoms are traditionally and somewhat arbitrarily divided into `` left '' and `` right '' sided , recognizing that the left and right ventricles of the *$%^ supply different portions of the circulation . However , *$%^ *$%^ is not exclusively backward *$%^ ( in the part of the circulation which drains to the ventricle ) . There are several other exceptions to a simple left-right division of *$%^ *$%^ symptoms . Additionally , the most common cause of right-sided *$%^ *$%^ is left-sided *$%^ *$%^ . [ 22 ] The result is that patients commonly present with both sets of signs and symptoms . The left side of the *$%^ is responsible for receiving oxygen-rich blood from the lungs and pumping it forward to the rest of the body . *$%^ of the left side of the *$%^ causes blood to back up ( be congested ) into the lungs , causing respiratory symptoms as well as fatigue due to insufficient supply of oxygenated blood . Common respiratory signs are increased rate of breathing and increased work of breathing ( non-specific signs of respiratory distress ) . Rales or crackles , heard initially in the lung bases , and when severe , throughout the lung fields suggest the development of pulmonary edema ( fluid in the alveoli ) . Cyanosis which suggests severe low blood oxygen , is a late sign of extremely severe pulmonary edema . Additional signs indicating left ventricular *$%^ include a laterally displaced apex beat ( which occurs if the *$%^ is enlarged ) and a gallop rhythm ( additional *$%^ sounds ) may be heard as a marker of increased blood flow , or increased intra-cardiac pressure . *$%^ murmurs may indicate the presence of valvular *$%^ disease , either as a cause ( e.g . aortic stenosis ) or as a result ( e.g . mitral regurgitation ) of the *$%^ *$%^ . Backward *$%^ of the left ventricle causes congestion of the lungs ' blood vessels , and so the symptoms are predominantly respiratory in nature . Backward *$%^ can be subdivided into *$%^ of the left atrium , the left ventricle or both within the left circuit . The patient will have dyspnea ( shortness of breath ) on exertion and in severe cases , dyspnea at rest . Increasing breathlessness on lying flat , called orthopnea , occurs . It is often measured in the number of pillows required to lie comfortably , and in orthopnea , the patient may resort to sleeping while sitting up . Another symptom of *$%^ *$%^ is paroxysmal nocturnal dyspnea : a sudden nighttime attack of severe breathlessness , usually several hours after going to sleep . Easy fatigability and exercise intolerance are also common complaints related to respiratory compromise . `` Cardiac asthma '' or wheezing may occur . Compromise of left ventricular forward function may result in symptoms of poor systemic circulation such as dizziness , confusion and cool extremities at rest . Physical examination may reveal pitting peripheral edema , ascites , and liver enlargement . Jugular venous pressure is frequently assessed as a marker of fluid status , which can be accentuated by eliciting hepatojugular reflux . If the right ventricular pressure is increased , a parasternal heave may be present , signifying the compensatory increase in contraction strength . Backward *$%^ of the right ventricle leads to congestion of systemic capillaries . This generates excess fluid accumulation in the body . This causes swelling under the skin ( termed peripheral edema or anasarca ) and usually affects the dependent parts of the body first ( causing foot and ankle swelling in people who are standing up , and sacral edema in people who are predominantly lying down ) . Nocturia ( frequent nighttime urination ) may occur when fluid from the legs is returned to the bloodstream while lying down at night . In progressively severe cases , ascites ( fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity causing swelling ) and liver enlargement may develop . Significant liver congestion may result in impaired liver function , and jaundice and even coagulopathy ( problems of decreased blood clotting ) may occur . Dullness of the lung fields to finger percussion and reduced breath sounds at the bases of the lung may suggest the development of a pleural effusion ( fluid collection between the lung and the chest wall ) . Though it can occur in isolated left- or right-sided *$%^ *$%^ , it is more common in biventricular *$%^ because pleural veins drain into both the systemic and pulmonary venous systems . When unilateral , effusions are often right sided .", "Heart failure"], ["*$%^ *$%^ is often either asymptomatic ( producing no noticeable symptoms ) or it may cause only nonspecific symptoms ( symptoms that are specific not only to *$%^ *$%^ , but also to other related or unrelated disorders ) in its early stages . By the time symptoms occur , the *$%^ has often reached an advanced stage ( see below ) and may have also metastasized ( spread to other , perhaps distant , parts of the body ) , which is one of the main reasons for its relatively poor prognosis . [ 15 ] *$%^ *$%^ can cause the following signs and symptoms : Early cancers may be associated with indigestion or a burning sensation ( heartburn ) . However , less than 1 in every 50 people referred for endoscopy due to indigestion has *$%^ . [ 16 ] Abdominal discomfort and loss of appetite , especially for meat , can occur . Gastric cancers that have enlarged and invaded normal tissue can cause weakness , fatigue , bloating of the *$%^ after meals , abdominal pain in the upper abdomen , nausea and occasional vomiting , diarrhea or constipation . Further enlargement may cause weight loss or bleeding with vomiting blood or having blood in the stool , the latter apparent as black discolouration ( melena ) and sometimes leading to anemia . Dysphagia suggests a tumour in the cardia or extension of the gastric tumour into the esophagus . Note that these can be symptoms of other problems such as a *$%^ virus , gastric ulcer , or tropical sprue .", "Stomach cancer"], ["The cause of *$%^ *$%^ is unclear but several causes have been proposed . [ 1 ] It has also been called stenosing tenosynovitis ( specifically digital tenovaginitis stenosans ) , but this may be a misnomer , as inflammation is not a predominant feature . It has been speculated that repetitive forceful use of a digit leads to narrowing of the fibrous digital sheath in which it runs , but there is little scientific data to support this theory . The relationship of *$%^ *$%^ to work activities is debatable and scientific evidence for [ 2 ] and against [ 3 ] hand use as a cause exist . While the mechanism is unclear , there is some evidence that triggering of the thumb is more likely to occur following surgery for carpal tunnel syndrome . [ 4 ] it may also occur in rheumatoid arthritis", "Trigger finger"], ["Depending on the site of infection , *$%^ has six characteristic clinical variants : ulceroglandular ( the most common type representing 75 % of all forms ) , glandular , oropharyngeal , pneumonic , oculoglandular , and typhoidal . [ 5 ] The incubation period for *$%^ is one to 14 days ; most human infections become apparent after three to five days . [ 6 ] In most susceptible mammals , the clinical signs include fever , lethargy , loss of appetite , signs of sepsis , and possibly death . Nonhuman mammals rarely develop the skin lesions seen in people . Subclinical infections are common , and animals often develop specific antibodies to the organism . Fever is moderate or very high , and *$%^ bacilli can be isolated from blood cultures at this stage . The face and eyes redden and become inflamed . Inflammation spreads to the lymph nodes , which enlarge and may suppurate ( mimicking bubonic plague ) . Lymph node involvement is accompanied by a high fever . Death occurs in less than 1 % of cases if therapy is initiated promptly . The bacteria can penetrate into the body through damaged skin and mucous membranes , or through inhalation . Humans are most often infected by tick bite or through handling an infected animal . Ingesting infected water , soil , or food can also cause infection . *$%^ can also be acquired by inhalation ; hunters are at a higher risk for this disease because of the potential of inhaling the bacteria during the skinning process . It has been contracted from inhaling particles from an infected rabbit ground up in a lawnmower ( see below ) . *$%^ is not spread directly from person to person . [ 7 ] Francisella tularensis is an intracellular bacterium , meaning it is able to live as a parasite within host cells . It primarily infects macrophages , a type of white blood cell , thus is able to evade the immune system . The course of disease involves the spread of the organism to multiple organ systems , including the lungs , liver , spleen , and lymphatic system . The course of disease is different depending on the route of exposure . Mortality in untreated ( before the antibiotic era ) patients has been as high as 50 % in the pneumoniac and typhoidal forms of the disease , which however account for less than 10 % of cases . [ 8 ] Overall mortality was 7 % for untreated cases , and the disease responds well to antibiotics , with a fatality rate of about 1 % . The exact cause of death is unclear , but it is thought to be a combination of multiple organ system failures .", "Tularemia"], ["Iron overload : People with *$%^ can get an overload of iron in their bodies , either from the disease itself or from frequent blood transfusions . Too much iron can result in damage to the heart , liver , and endocrine system , which includes glands that produce hormones that regulate processes throughout the body . The damage is characterized by excessive deposits of iron . Without adequate iron chelation therapy , almost all patients with beta-thalassemia accumulate potentially fatal iron levels . [ 5 ] Infection : People with *$%^ have an increased risk of infection . This is especially true if the spleen has been removed . [ citation needed ] Bone deformities : *$%^ can make the bone marrow expand , which causes bones to widen . This can result in abnormal bone structure , especially in the face and skull . Bone marrow expansion also makes bones thin and brittle , increasing the risk of broken bones . [ 6 ] Enlarged spleen : The spleen aids in fighting infection and filters unwanted material , such as old or damaged blood cells . *$%^ is often accompanied by the destruction of a large number of red blood cells and the task of removing these cells causes the spleen to enlarge . Splenomegaly can make anemia worse , and it can reduce the life of transfused red blood cells . Severe enlargement of the spleen may necessitate its removal . [ citation needed ] Slowed growth rates : Anemia can cause a child 's growth to slow . Puberty also may be delayed in children with *$%^ . [ citation needed ] Heart problems : Diseases , such as congestive heart failure and abnormal heart rhythms , may be associated with severe *$%^ . [ 7 ]", "Thalassemia"], ["*$%^ is a systemic inflammatory disease that can affect any organ , although it can be asymptomatic and is discovered by accident in about 5 % of cases . [ 11 ] Common symptoms , which tend to be vague , include fatigue ( unrelieved by sleep ; occurs in 66 % of cases ) , lack of energy , weight loss , joint aches and pains ( which occur in about 70 % of cases ) , [ 5 ] arthritis ( 14\u201338 % of persons ) , dry eyes , swelling of the knees , blurry vision , shortness of breath , a dry , hacking cough , or skin lesions . [ 1 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] [ 14 ] Less commonly , people may cough up blood . [ 1 ] The cutaneous symptoms vary , and range from rashes and noduli ( small bumps ) to erythema nodosum , granuloma annulare , or lupus pernio . *$%^ and cancer may mimic one another , making the distinction difficult . [ 15 ] The combination of erythema nodosum , bilateral hilar lymphadenopathy , and joint pain is called L\u00f6fgren syndrome which has a relatively good prognosis . [ 1 ] This form of the disease occurs significantly more commonly in Scandinavian patients , than in those of non-Scandinavian origin . [ 7 ] Localization to the lungs is by far the most common manifestation of *$%^ . [ 16 ] At least 90 % of affected persons experience lung involvement . [ 2 ] Overall , about 50 % develop permanent pulmonary abnormalities , and 5 to 15 % have progressive fibrosis of the lung parenchyma . *$%^ of the lung is primarily an interstitial lung disease in which the inflammatory process involves the alveoli , small bronchi and small blood vessels . [ 17 ] In acute and subacute cases , physical examination usually reveals dry crackles . [ 2 ] At least 5 % of persons will suffer pulmonary arterial hypertension . [ 2 ] [ 18 ] Less commonly , the upper respiratory tract ( including the larynx , pharynx , and sinuses ) may be affected , which occurs in between 5 and 10 % of cases . [ 19 ] *$%^ of the lungs can be divided into four stages . Stage 0 \u2014 No intrathoracic involvement . Stage I \u2014 Bilateral hilar adenopathy . Stage II \u2014 Pulmonary parenchyma involved . Stage III \u2014 Pulmonary infiltrates with fibrosis . [ 2 ] Stage 4 is end-stage lung disease with pulmonary fibrosis and honeycombing . [ 20 ] *$%^ involves the skin in between 9 and 37 % of persons and is more common in African Americans than in their white counterparts . [ 2 ] The skin is the second most commonly affected organ , after the lungs . [ 21 ] The most common lesions are erythema nodosum , plaques , maculopapular eruptions , subcutaneous nodules , and lupus pernio . [ 21 ] Treatment is not required , since the lesions usually resolve spontaneously in two to four weeks . Although it may be disfiguring , cutaneous *$%^ rarely causes major problems . [ 2 ] [ 22 ] [ 23 ] *$%^ of the scalp presents with diffuse or patchy hair loss . [ 24 ] [ 25 ] The frequency of cardiac involvement varies and is significantly influenced by race ; in Japan over 25 % of persons with *$%^ experience symptomatic cardiac involvement , whereas in the US and Europe only about 5 % of cases present with cardiac involvement . [ 2 ] Autopsy studies in the US have revealed a frequency of cardiac involvement of about 20\u201330 % , whereas autopsy studies in Japan have shown a frequency of 60 % . [ 13 ] The presentation of cardiac *$%^ can range from asymptomatic conduction abnormalities to fatal ventricular arrhythmia . [ 26 ] Conduction abnormalities are the most common cardiac manifestations of *$%^ among persons and can include complete heart block . [ 27 ] Second to conduction abnormalities , in frequency , are ventricular arrhythmias and occurs in about 23 % of persons with cardiac involvement . [ 27 ] Sudden cardiac death , either due to ventricular arrhythmias or complete heart block is a rare complication of cardiac *$%^ . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] Cardiac *$%^ can cause fibrosis , granuloma formation or the accumulation of fluid in the interstitium of the heart or a combination of the former two . [ 30 ] Eye involvement occurs in about 10\u201390 % of cases . [ 13 ] Manifestations in the eye include uveitis , uveoparotitis , and retinal inflammation , which may result in loss of visual acuity or blindness . [ 31 ] The most common ophthalmologic manifestation of *$%^ is uveitis . [ 13 ] [ 32 ] The combination of anterior uveitis , parotitis , VII cranial nerve paralysis and fever is called uveoparotid fever or Heerfordt syndrome ( D86.8 ) . Development of scleral nodule associated with *$%^ have been observed . [ 33 ] Any of the components of the nervous system can be involved . [ 34 ] *$%^ affecting the nervous system is known as neurosarcoidosis . [ 34 ] Cranial nerves are most commonly affected , accounting for about 5\u201330 % of neurosarcoidosis cases , and peripheral facial nerve palsy , often bilateral , is the most common neurological manifestation of *$%^ . [ 34 ] [ 35 ] [ 36 ] It occurs suddenly and is usually transient . The central nervous system involvement is present in 10\u201325 % of *$%^ cases . [ 19 ] Other common manifestations of neurosarcoid include optic nerve dysfunction , papilledema , palate dysfunction , neuroendocrine changes , hearing abnormalities , hypothalamic and pituitary abnormalities , chronic meningitis , and peripheral neuropathy . [ 2 ] Myelopathy , that is spinal cord involvement , occurs in about 16\u201343 % of neurosarcoidosis cases and is often associated with the poorest prognosis of the neurosarcoidosis subtypes . [ 34 ] Whereas facial nerve palsies and acute meningitis due to *$%^ tends to have the most favourable prognosis . [ 34 ] Another common finding in *$%^ with neurological involvement is autonomic or sensory small fiber neuropathy . [ 37 ] [ 38 ] Neuroendocrine *$%^ accounts for about 5\u201310 % of neurosarcoidosis cases and can lead to diabetes insipidus , changes in menstrual cycle and hypothalamic dysfunction . [ 34 ] [ 36 ] The latter can lead to changes in body temperature , mood and prolactin ( see the endocrine and exocrine section for details ) . [ 34 ] Prolactin is frequently increased in *$%^ , between 3 % and 32 % of cases have hyperprolactinemia [ 39 ] this frequently leads to amenorrhea , galactorrhea , or nonpuerperal mastitis in women . It also frequently causes an increase in 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D , the active metabolite of vitamin D , which is usually hydrolysed within the kidney , but in *$%^ patients hydroxylation of vitamin D can occur outside the kidneys , namely inside the immune cells found in the granulomas the condition produces . 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 is the main cause for hypercalcemia in *$%^ and overproduced by sarcoid granulomata . Gamma-interferon produced by activated lymphocytes and macrophages plays a major role in the synthesis of 1 alpha , 25 ( OH ) 2D3 . [ 40 ] Hypercalciuria ( excessive secretion of calcium in one 's urine ) and hypercalcemia ( an excessively high amount of calcium in the blood ) are seen in < 10 % of individuals and likely results from the increased 1,25-dihydroxy vitamin D production . [ 41 ] Thyroid dysfunction is seen in 4.2\u20134.6 % of cases . [ 42 ] [ 43 ] Parotid enlargement occurs in about 5\u201310 % of persons . [ 5 ] Bilateral involvement is the rule . The gland is usually not tender , but firm and smooth . Dry mouth can occur ; other exocrine glands are affected only rarely . [ 2 ] The eyes , their glands , or the parotid glands are affected in 20 % -50 % of cases . [ 44 ] Symptomatic GI involvement occurs in less than 1 % of persons ( note that this is if one excludes the liver ) , and most commonly the stomach is affected , although the small or large intestine may also be affected in a small portion of cases . [ 5 ] [ 45 ] Studies at autopsy have revealed GI involvement in less than 10 % of people . [ 36 ] These cases would likely mimic Crohn 's disease , which is a more commonly intestine-affecting granulomatous disease . [ 5 ] About 1\u20133 % of people have evidence of pancreatic involvement at autopsy . [ 36 ] Symptomatic kidney involvement occurs in just 0.7 % of cases , although evidence of kidney involvement at autopsy has been reported in up to 22 % of people and occurs exclusively in cases of chronic disease . [ 5 ] [ 13 ] [ 36 ] Symptomatic kidney involvement is usually nephrocalcinosis , although granulomatous interstitial nephritis that presents with reduced creatinine clearance and little proteinuria is a close second . [ 5 ] [ 36 ] Less commonly , the epididymis , testicles , prostate , ovaries , fallopian tubes , uterus , or the vulva may be affected , the latter may cause vulva itchiness . [ 13 ] [ 46 ] [ 47 ] Testicular involvement has been reported in about 5 % of people at autopsy . [ 36 ] [ 47 ] In males , *$%^ may lead to infertility . [ 48 ] Around 70 % of people have granulomas in their livers , although only in about 20\u201330 % of cases liver function test anomalies reflecting this fact are seen . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] About 5\u201315 % of persons exhibit hepatomegaly , that is an enlarged liver . [ 13 ] Only 5\u201330 % of cases of liver involvement are symptomatic . [ 49 ] Usually , these changes reflect a cholestatic pattern and include raised levels of alkaline phosphatase ( which is the most common liver function test anomaly seen in persons with *$%^ ) , while bilirubin and aminotransferases are only mildly elevated . Jaundice is rare . [ 2 ] [ 5 ] Abnormal clinical blood tests are frequent , accounting for over 50 % of cases , but is not diagnostic . [ 2 ] [ 19 ] Lymphopenia is the most common hematologic anomaly in *$%^ . [ 2 ] Anemia occurs in about 20 % of people with *$%^ . [ 2 ] Leukopenia is less common and occurs in even fewer persons but is rarely severe . [ 2 ] Thrombocytopenia and hemolytic anemia are fairly rare . [ 5 ] In the absence of splenomegaly , leukopenia may reflect bone marrow involvement , but the most common mechanism is a redistribution of blood T cells to sites of disease . [ 50 ] Other nonspecific findings include monocytosis , occurring in the majority of *$%^ cases , [ 51 ] increased hepatic enzymes or alkaline phosphatase . People with *$%^ often have immunologic anomalies like allergies to test antigens such as Candida or purified protein derivative ( PPD ) . [ 44 ] Polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia is also a fairly common immunologic anomaly seen in *$%^ . [ 44 ] Lymphadenopathy ( swollen glands ) is common in *$%^ and occurs in 15 % of cases . [ 14 ] Intrathoracic nodes are enlarged in 75 to 90 % of all people ; usually this involves the hilar nodes , but the paratracheal nodes are commonly involved . Peripheral lymphadenopathy is very common , particularly involving the cervical ( the most common head and neck manifestation of the disease ) , axillary , epitrochlear , and inguinal nodes . [ 52 ] Approximately 75 % of cases show microscopic involvement of the spleen , although only in about 5\u201310 % of cases does splenomegaly appear . [ 5 ] [ 44 ] *$%^ can be involved with the joints , bones and muscles . This causes a wide variety of musculoskeletal complaints that act through different mechanisms . [ 53 ] About 5\u201315 % of cases affect the bones , joints , or muscles . [ 19 ] There are two ways that arthritic syndromes can be categorized in : acute or chronic . [ 53 ] *$%^ patients with acute arthritis often also accompanies bilateral Hilar lymphadenopathy and Erythema nodosum . These three associated syndromes often occurs in L\u00f6fgren syndrome . [ 53 ] When looking at the arthritis symptoms of L\u00f6fgren syndrome , it shows that the ankles are most commonly affected , followed by the knees , wrists , elbows , wrists , and metacarpophalangeal joints . [ 53 ] Usually true arthritis is not present , but instead periarthritis presents itself as a swelling in the soft tissue around the joints that can be seen by ultrasonographic methods . [ 53 ] These joint symptoms tend to precede or occur at the same time as erythema nodosum develops . [ 53 ] Even when erythema nodosum is absent , it is believed that the combination of hilar lymphadenopathy and ankle periarthritis van be considered as a variant of L\u00f6fgren syndrome . [ 53 ] Enthesitis also occurs in about one-third of patients with acute sarcoid arthritis , mainly affecting the Achilles tendon and heels . [ 53 ] Soft tissue swelling at the ankles can be prominent , and biopsy of this soft tissue reveals no granulomas but does show panniculitis that is similar to erythema nodosum . [ 53 ] Chronic sarcoid arthritis usually occurs in the setting of more diffuse organ involvement . [ 53 ] The ankles , knees , wrists , elbows , and hands may all be affected in the chronic form and often this presents itself in a polyarticular pattern . [ 53 ] Dactylitis similar to that seen in Psoriatic arthritis , that is associated with pain , swelling , overlying skin erythema , and underlying bony changes may also occur . [ 53 ] Development of Jaccoud arthropathy ( a nonerosive deformity ) is very rarely seen . [ 53 ] Bone involvement in *$%^ has been reported in 1\u201313 % of cases . [ 36 ] The most frequent sites of involvement are the hands and feet , whereas the spine is less commonly affected . [ 53 ] Half of the patients with bony lesions experience pain and stiffness , whereas the other half remain asymptomatic . [ 53 ] Periostitis is rarely seen in *$%^ and has been found to present itself at the femoral bone . [ 54 ] [ 55 ]", "Sarcoidosis"], ["Women who experience pain with attempted intercourse describe their pain in many ways . This reflects how many different and overlapping causes there are for *$%^ . [ 2 ] The location , nature , and time course of the pain help to understand potential causes and treatments . Some women describe superficial pain at the opening of the vagina or surface of the genitalia when penetration is initiated . Other women feel deeper pain in the vault of the vagina or deep within the pelvis upon deeper penetration . Some women feel pain in more than one of these places . Determining whether the pain is more superficial or deep is important in understanding what may be causing a woman 's pain . [ 3 ] Some women have always experienced pain with intercourse from their very first attempt . Other women begin to feel pain with intercourse after an injury or infection or cyclically with menstruation . Sometimes the pain increases over time . When pain occurs , the woman may be distracted from feeling pleasure and excitement . Both vaginal lubrication and vaginal dilation decrease . When the vagina is dry and undilated , penetration is more painful . Fear of being in pain can make the discomfort worse . Even after the original source of pain has disappeared , a woman may feel pain simply because she expects pain . Fear , avoidance , and psychologic distress around attempting intercourse can become large parts of a woman 's experience of *$%^ . [ 4 ] Physical examination of the vulva ( external genitalia ) may reveal clear reasons for pain including lesions , thin skin , ulcerations or discharge associated with vulvovaginal infections or vaginal atrophy . An internal pelvic exam may also reveal physical reasons for pain including lesions on the cervix or anatomic variation . [ 5 ] When there are no visible findings on vulvar exam that would suggest a cause for superficial *$%^ , a cotton-swab test may be performed . This is a test to assess for localized provoked vulvodynia . [ 4 ] A cotton tip applicator is applied at several points around the opening of the vagina and a woman reports whether she experiences pain on a scale from 0-10 .", "Dyspareunia"], ["*$%^ *$%^ can cause a variety of symptoms and signs which vary depending on the individual and the duration of *$%^ exposure . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Symptoms are nonspecific and may be subtle , and someone with elevated *$%^ levels may have no symptoms . [ 17 ] Symptoms usually develop over weeks to months as *$%^ builds up in the body during a chronic exposure , but acute symptoms from brief , intense exposures also occur . [ 18 ] Symptoms from exposure to organic *$%^ , which is probably more toxic than inorganic *$%^ due to its lipid solubility , occur rapidly . [ 19 ] *$%^ by organic *$%^ compounds has symptoms predominantly in the central nervous system , such as insomnia , delirium , cognitive deficits , tremor , hallucinations , and convulsions . [ 14 ] Symptoms may be different in adults and children ; the main symptoms in adults are headache , abdominal pain , memory loss , kidney failure , male reproductive problems , and weakness , pain , or tingling in the extremities . [ 20 ] Early symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ in adults are commonly nonspecific and include depression , loss of appetite , intermittent abdominal pain , nausea , diarrhea , constipation , and muscle pain . [ 21 ] Other early signs in adults include malaise , fatigue , decreased libido , and problems with sleep . [ 15 ] An unusual taste in the mouth and personality changes are also early signs . [ 22 ] In adults , symptoms can occur at levels above 40 \u03bcg/dL , but are more likely to occur only above 50\u201360 \u03bcg/dL . [ 15 ] Symptoms begin to appear in children generally at around 60 \u03bcg/dL . [ 23 ] However , the *$%^ levels at which symptoms appear vary widely depending on unknown characteristics of each individual . [ 24 ] At blood *$%^ levels between 25 and 60 \u03bcg/dL , neuropsychiatric effects such as delayed reaction times , irritability , and difficulty concentrating , as well as slowed motor nerve conduction and headache can occur . [ 25 ] Anemia may appear at blood *$%^ levels higher than 50 \u03bcg/dL . [ 21 ] In adults , abdominal colic , involving paroxysms of pain , may appear at blood *$%^ levels greater than 80 \u03bcg/dL . [ 16 ] Signs that occur in adults at blood *$%^ levels exceeding 100 \u03bcg/dL include wrist drop and foot drop , and signs of encephalopathy ( a condition characterized by brain swelling ) , such as those that accompany increased pressure within the skull , delirium , coma , seizures , and headache . [ 26 ] In children , signs of encephalopathy such as bizarre behavior , discoordination , and apathy occur at *$%^ levels exceeding 70 \u03bcg/dL . [ 26 ] For both adults and children , it is rare to be asymptomatic if blood *$%^ levels exceed 100 \u03bcg/dL . [ 16 ] In acute *$%^ , typical neurological signs are pain , muscle weakness , paraesthesia , and , rarely , symptoms associated with encephalitis . [ 20 ] Abdominal pain , nausea , vomiting , diarrhea , and constipation are other acute symptoms . [ 27 ] *$%^ 's effects on the mouth include astringency and a metallic taste . [ 27 ] Gastrointestinal problems , such as constipation , diarrhea , poor appetite , or weight loss , are common in acute *$%^ . Absorption of large amounts of *$%^ over a short time can cause shock ( insufficient fluid in the circulatory system ) due to loss of water from the gastrointestinal tract . [ 27 ] Hemolysis ( the rupture of red blood cells ) due to acute *$%^ can cause anemia and hemoglobin in the urine . [ 27 ] Damage to kidneys can cause changes in urination such as decreased urine output . [ 27 ] People who survive acute *$%^ often go on to display symptoms of chronic *$%^ . [ 27 ] Chronic *$%^ usually presents with symptoms affecting multiple systems , [ 14 ] but is associated with three main types of symptoms : gastrointestinal , neuromuscular , and neurological . [ 20 ] Central nervous system and neuromuscular symptoms usually result from intense exposure , while gastrointestinal symptoms usually result from exposure over longer periods . [ 27 ] Signs of chronic exposure include loss of short-term memory or concentration , depression , nausea , abdominal pain , loss of coordination , and numbness and tingling in the extremities . [ 22 ] Fatigue , problems with sleep , headaches , stupor , slurred speech , and anemia are also found in chronic *$%^ *$%^ . [ 20 ] A `` *$%^ hue '' of the skin with pallor and/or lividity is another feature . [ 28 ] [ 29 ] A blue line along the gum with bluish black edging to the teeth , known as a Burton line , is another indication of chronic *$%^ *$%^ . [ 30 ] Children with chronic *$%^ may refuse to play or may have hyperkinetic or aggressive behavior disorders . [ 20 ] Visual disturbance may present with gradually progressing blurred vision as a result of central scotoma , caused by toxic optic neuritis . [ 31 ] A fetus developing in the womb of a woman who has elevated blood *$%^ level is susceptible to *$%^ *$%^ by intrauterine exposure , and is at greater risk of being born prematurely or with a low birth weight . [ 32 ] Children are more at risk for *$%^ *$%^ because their smaller bodies are in a continuous state of growth and development . [ 33 ] *$%^ is absorbed at a faster rate compared to adults , which causes more physical harm than to older people . Furthermore , children , especially as they are learning to crawl and walk , are constantly on the floor and therefore more prone to ingesting and inhaling dust that is contaminated with *$%^ . [ 34 ] The classic signs and symptoms in children are loss of appetite , abdominal pain , vomiting , weight loss , constipation , anemia , kidney failure , irritability , lethargy , learning disabilities , and behavioral problems . [ 33 ] Slow development of normal childhood behaviors , such as talking and use of words , and permanent intellectual disability are both commonly seen . [ 32 ] Although less common , it is possible for fingernails to develop leukonychia striata if exposed to abnormally high *$%^ concentrations . [ 35 ] *$%^ affects every one of the body 's organ systems , especially the nervous system , but also the bones and teeth , the kidneys , and the cardiovascular , immune , and reproductive systems . [ 36 ] Hearing loss and tooth decay have been linked to *$%^ exposure , [ 37 ] as have cataracts . [ 38 ] Intrauterine and neonatal *$%^ exposure promote tooth decay . [ 39 ] [ 40 ] [ 41 ] [ 42 ] [ 43 ] [ 44 ] [ 45 ] Aside from the developmental effects unique to young children , the health effects experienced by adults are similar to those in children , although the thresholds are generally higher . [ 46 ] Kidney damage occurs with exposure to high levels of *$%^ , and evidence suggests that lower levels can damage kidneys as well . [ 47 ] The toxic effect of *$%^ causes nephropathy and may cause Fanconi syndrome , in which the proximal tubular function of the kidney is impaired . [ 48 ] Long-term exposure at levels lower than those that cause *$%^ nephropathy have also been reported as nephrotoxic in patients from developed countries that had chronic kidney disease or were at risk because of hypertension or diabetes mellitus . [ 49 ] *$%^ *$%^ inhibits excretion of the waste product urate and causes a predisposition for gout , in which urate builds up . [ 50 ] [ 51 ] [ 52 ] This condition is known as saturnine gout . Evidence suggests *$%^ exposure is associated with high blood pressure , and studies have also found connections between *$%^ exposure and coronary heart disease , heart rate variability , and death from stroke , but this evidence is more limited . [ 53 ] People who have been exposed to higher concentrations of *$%^ may be at a higher risk for cardiac autonomic dysfunction on days when ozone and fine particles are higher . [ 54 ] *$%^ affects both the male and female reproductive systems . In men , when blood *$%^ levels exceed 40 \u03bcg/dL , sperm count is reduced and changes occur in volume of sperm , their motility , and their morphology . [ 55 ] A pregnant woman 's elevated blood *$%^ level can *$%^ to miscarriage , prematurity , low birth weight , and problems with development during childhood . [ 56 ] *$%^ is able to pass through the placenta and into breast milk , and blood *$%^ levels in mothers and infants are usually similar . [ 18 ] A fetus may be poisoned in utero if *$%^ from the mother 's bones is subsequently mobilized by the changes in metabolism due to pregnancy ; increased calcium intake in pregnancy may help mitigate this phenomenon . [ 57 ] *$%^ affects the peripheral nervous system ( especially motor nerves ) and the central nervous system . [ 18 ] Peripheral nervous system effects are more prominent in adults and central nervous system effects are more prominent in children . [ 24 ] *$%^ causes the axons of nerve cells to degenerate and lose their myelin coats . [ 18 ] *$%^ exposure in young children has been linked to learning disabilities , [ 59 ] and children with blood *$%^ concentrations greater than 10 \u03bcg/dL are in danger of developmental disabilities . [ 27 ] Increased blood *$%^ level in children has been correlated with decreases in intelligence , nonverbal reasoning , short-term memory , attention , reading and arithmetic ability , fine motor skills , emotional regulation , and social engagement . [ 56 ] The effect of *$%^ on children 's cognitive abilities takes place at very low levels . [ 37 ] [ 56 ] [ 60 ] There is apparently no lower threshold to the dose-response relationship ( unlike other heavy metals such as mercury ) . [ 61 ] Reduced academic performance has been associated with *$%^ exposure even at blood *$%^ levels lower than 5 \u03bcg/dL . [ 62 ] [ 63 ] Blood *$%^ levels below 10 \u03bcg/dL have been reported to be associated with lower IQ and behavior problems such as aggression , in proportion with blood *$%^ levels . [ 6 ] Between the blood *$%^ levels of 5 and 35 \u03bcg/dL , an IQ decrease of 2\u20134 points for each \u03bcg/dL increase is reported in children . [ 27 ] High blood *$%^ levels in adults are also associated with decreases in cognitive performance and with psychiatric symptoms such as depression and anxiety . [ 64 ] It was found in a large group of current and former inorganic *$%^ workers in Korea that blood *$%^ levels in the range of 20\u201350 \u03bcg/dL were correlated with neuro-cognitive defects . [ 65 ] Increases in blood *$%^ levels from about 50 to about 100 \u03bcg/dL in adults have been found to be associated with persistent , and possibly permanent , impairment of central nervous system function . [ 47 ] *$%^ exposure in children is also correlated with neuropsychiatric disorders such as attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and anti-social behaviour . [ 60 ] Elevated *$%^ levels in children are correlated with higher scores on aggression and delinquency measures . [ 23 ] A correlation has also been found between prenatal and early childhood *$%^ exposure and violent crime in adulthood . [ 56 ] Countries with the highest air *$%^ levels have also been found to have the highest murder rates , after adjusting for confounding factors . [ 23 ] A May 2000 study by economic consultant Rick Nevin theorizes that *$%^ exposure explains 65 % to 90 % of the variation in violent crime rates in the US . [ 66 ] [ 67 ] A 2007 paper by the same author claims to show a strong association between preschool blood *$%^ and subsequent crime rate trends over several decades across nine countries . [ 68 ] [ 69 ] It is believed that the U.S. ban on *$%^ paint in buildings in the late 1970s , as well as the phaseout of leaded gasoline in the 1970s and 1980s , partially helped contribute to the decline of violent crime in the United States since the early 1990s . [ 69 ]", "Lead poisoning"], ["Symptoms or signs of *$%^ may not appear until 20 to 50 years ( or more ) after exposure to asbestos . Shortness of breath , cough , and pain in the chest due to an accumulation of fluid in the pleural space ( pleural effusion ) are often symptoms of pleural *$%^ . [ 5 ] The most common symptoms of peritoneal *$%^ are abdominal swelling and pain due to ascites ( a buildup of fluid in the abdominal cavity ) . Other features may include weight loss , fever , night sweats , poor appetite , vomiting , constipation , and umbilical hernia . [ 6 ] If the cancer has spread beyond the mesothelium to other parts of the body , symptoms may include pain , trouble swallowing , or swelling of the neck or face . [ citation needed ] These symptoms may be caused by *$%^ or by other , less serious conditions . *$%^ that affects the pleura can cause these signs and symptoms : [ 5 ] Chest wall pain Pleural effusion , or fluid surrounding the lung Shortness of breath Fatigue or anemia Wheezing , hoarseness , or cough Blood in the sputum ( fluid ) coughed up ( hemoptysis ) In severe cases , the person may have many tumor masses . The individual may develop a pneumothorax , or collapse of the lung . The disease may metastasize , or spread to other parts of the body .

Symptoms include : [ citation needed ] Abdominal pain Ascites , or an abnormal buildup of fluid in the abdomen A mass in the abdomen Problems with bowel function Weight loss In severe cases of the disease , the following signs and symptoms may be present : [ citation needed ] Blood clots in the veins , which may cause thrombophlebitis Disseminated intravascular coagulation , a disorder causing severe bleeding in many body organs Jaundice , or yellowing of the eyes and skin Low blood sugar level Pleural effusion Pulmonary emboli , or blood clots in the arteries of the lungs Severe ascites A *$%^ does not usually spread to the bone , brain , or adrenal glands . Pleural tumors are usually found only on one side of the lungs . [ citation needed ] Pericardial *$%^ is not well characterized , but observed cases have included cardiac symptoms , specifically constrictive pericarditis , heart failure , pulmonary embolism , and cardiac tamponade . They have also included nonspecific symptoms , including substernal chest pain , orthopnea ( shortness of breath when lying flat ) , and cough . These symptoms are caused by the tumor encasing or infiltrating the heart . [ 2 ]", "Mesothelioma"], ["Many patients first complain of pain that may be worse at night , may be intermittent and of varying intensity and may have been occurring for some time . Teenagers who are active in sports often complain of pain in the lower femur , or immediately below the knee . If the tumor is large , it can present as overt localised swelling . Sometimes a sudden fracture is the first symptom , because affected bone is not as strong as normal bone and may fracture abnormally with minor trauma . In cases of more deep-seated tumors that are not as close to the skin , such as those originating in the pelvis , localised swelling may not be apparent .", "Osteosarcoma"], ["*$%^ is characterized by a `` barking '' cough , stridor , hoarseness , and difficulty breathing which usually worsens at night . [ 3 ] The `` barking '' cough is often described as resembling the call of a seal or sea lion . [ 4 ] The stridor is worsened by agitation or crying , and if it can be heard at rest , it may indicate critical narrowing of the airways . As *$%^ worsens , stridor may decrease considerably . [ 3 ] Other symptoms include fever , coryza ( symptoms typical of the common cold ) , and chest wall indrawing . [ 3 ] [ 5 ] Drooling or a very sick appearance indicate other medical conditions . [ 5 ]", "Croup"], ["Typically , *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ is diagnosed shortly after birth , although it may develop well into adulthood , because of the presence of megacolon , or because the baby fails to pass the first stool ( meconium ) [ 3 ] within 48 hours of delivery . Normally , 90 % of babies pass their first meconium within 24 hours , and 99 % within 48 hours . Other symptoms include green or brown vomit , explosive stools after a doctor inserts a finger into the rectum , swelling of the abdomen , lots of gas and bloody diarrhea . Some cases are diagnosed later , into childhood , but usually before age 10 . [ 3 ] The child may experience fecal retention , constipation , or abdominal distention . [ 3 ] With an incidence of one in 5,000 births , the most cited feature is absence of ganglion cells : notably in males , 75 percent have none in the end of the colon ( recto-sigmoid ) and eight percent lack ganglion cells in the entire colon . The enlarged section of the bowel is found proximally , while the narrowed , aganglionic section is found distally , closer to the end of the bowel . The absence of ganglion cells results in a persistent over-stimulation of nerves in the affected region , resulting in contraction . Some , extremely rare cases , the absence of ganglion cells continues to spread after the corrective surgery , resulting in multiple surgeries . Usually , the over-stimulated colon will actually absorb little , or no nutrition to benefit the patient . Those patients that also have thyroid cancer , may be able to digest food properly , but may not be able to use the nutrients properly .", "Hirschsprung's disease"], ["The defining symptoms of *$%^ are chronic widespread pain , fatigue , sleep disturbance , and heightened pain in response to tactile pressure ( allodynia ) . [ 22 ] Other symptoms may include tingling of the skin ( paresthesias ) , [ 22 ] prolonged muscle spasms , weakness in the limbs , nerve pain , muscle twitching , palpitations , [ 24 ] and functional bowel disturbances . [ 4 ] [ 25 ] Many people experience cognitive dysfunction [ 7 ] [ 22 ] ( known as `` fibrofog '' ) , which may be characterized by impaired concentration , [ 26 ] problems with short [ 8 ] [ 26 ] and long-term memory , short-term memory consolidation , [ 8 ] impaired speed of performance , [ 8 ] [ 26 ] inability to multi-task , cognitive overload , [ 8 ] [ 26 ] and diminished attention span . *$%^ is often associated with anxiety and depressive symptoms . [ 8 ] Other symptoms often attributed to *$%^ that may be due to a comorbid disorder include myofascial pain syndrome , also referred to as chronic myofascial pain , diffuse non-dermatomal paresthesias , functional bowel disturbances and irritable bowel syndrome , genitourinary symptoms and interstitial cystitis , dermatological disorders , headaches , myoclonic twitches , and symptomatic hypoglycemia . Although *$%^ is classified based on the presence of chronic widespread pain , pain may also be localized in areas such as the shoulders , neck , low back , hips , or other areas . Many sufferers also experience varying degrees of myofascial pain and have high rates of comorbid temporomandibular joint dysfunction . 20\u201330 % of people with rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematosus may also have *$%^ .

[ 6 ] It feels worse with deep breathing , coughing , sneezing , or laughing . The pain may stay in one place , or it may spread to the shoulder or back . [ 7 ] Sometimes , it becomes a fairly constant dull ache . [ 8 ] Depending on its cause , pleuritic chest pain may be accompanied by other symptoms : [ 9 ] Dry cough Fever and chills Rapid , shallow breathing Shortness of breath Tachycardia Sore throat followed by pain and swelling in the joints", "Pleurisy"], ["The symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ develop gradually and may become established before they are recognized . The most common ones are fatigue ; lightheadedness upon standing or difficulty standing ; muscle weakness ; fever ; weight loss ; anxiety ; nausea ; vomiting ; diarrhea ; headache ; sweating ; changes in mood or personality ; and joint and muscle pains . Some patients have cravings for salt or salty foods due to the loss of sodium through their urine . [ 1 ] Hyperpigmentation of the skin may be seen , particularly when the patient lives in a sunny area , as well as darkening of the palmar crease , sites of friction , recent scars , the vermilion border of the lips , and genital skin . [ 3 ] This is not encountered in secondary and tertiary hypoadrenalism . [ 2 ] On physical examination , the following clinical signs may be noticed : [ 1 ] Low blood pressure with or without orthostatic hypotension ( blood pressure that decreases with standing ) Darkening ( hyperpigmentation ) of the skin , including areas not exposed to the sun . Characteristic sites of darkening are skin creases ( e.g . of the hands ) , nipple , and the inside of the cheek ( buccal mucosa ) ; also , old scars may darken . This occurs because melanocyte-stimulating hormone ( MSH ) and adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) share the same precursor molecule , pro-opiomelanocortin ( POMC ) . After production in the anterior pituitary gland , POMC gets cleaved into gamma-MSH , ACTH and beta-lipotropin . The subunit ACTH undergoes further cleavage to produce alpha-MSH , the most important MSH for skin pigmentation . In secondary and tertiary forms of adrenal insufficiency , skin darkening does not occur , as ACTH is not overproduced . *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ is associated with the development of other autoimmune diseases , such as type I diabetes , thyroid *$%^ ( Hashimoto *$%^ thyroiditis ) , and vitiligo . The presence of *$%^ *$%^ in addition to one of these is called autoimmune polyendocrine syndrome . An `` Addisonian crisis '' or `` adrenal crisis '' is a constellation of symptoms that indicates severe adrenal insufficiency . This may be the result of either previously undiagnosed *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ , a *$%^ process suddenly affecting adrenal function ( such as adrenal hemorrhage ) , or an intercurrent problem ( e.g . infection , trauma ) in someone known to have *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . It is a medical emergency and potentially life-threatening situation requiring immediate emergency treatment . Characteristic symptoms are : [ 4 ] Sudden penetrating pain in the legs , lower back or abdomen Severe vomiting and diarrhea , resulting in dehydration Low blood pressure Syncope ( loss of consciousness and ability to stand ) Hypoglycemia ( reduced level of blood glucose ) Confusion , psychosis , slurred speech Severe lethargy Hyponatremia ( low sodium level in the blood ) Hyperkalemia ( elevated potassium level in the blood ) Hypercalcemia ( elevated calcium level in the blood ) Convulsions Fever", "Addison's disease"], ["Since *$%^ *$%^ usually does not cause recognizable symptoms in its early stages , the disease is typically not diagnosed until it has spread beyond the pancreas itself . [ 6 ] This is one of the main reasons for the generally poor survival rates . Exceptions to this are the functioning PanNETs , where over-production of various active hormones can give rise to symptoms ( which depend on the type of hormone ) . [ 26 ] Bearing in mind that the disease is rarely diagnosed before the age of 40 , common symptoms of *$%^ adenocarcinoma occurring before diagnosis include : Pain in the upper abdomen or back , often spreading from around the stomach to the back . The location of the pain can indicate the part of the pancreas where a tumor is located . The pain may be worse at night and may increase over time to become severe and unremitting . It may be slightly relieved by bending forward . [ 20 ] In the UK , about half of new cases of *$%^ *$%^ are diagnosed following a visit to a hospital emergency department for pain or jaundice . In up to two-thirds of people abdominal pain is the main symptom , for 46 % of the total accompanied by jaundice , with 13 % having jaundice without pain . [ 3 ] Jaundice , a yellow tint to the whites of the eyes or skin , with or without pain , and possibly in combination with darkened urine . This results when a *$%^ in the head of the pancreas obstructs the common bile duct as it runs through the pancreas . [ 27 ] Unexplained weight loss , either from loss of appetite , or loss of exocrine function resulting in poor digestion . [ 3 ] The tumor may compress neighboring organs , disrupting digestive processes and making it difficult for the stomach to empty , which may cause nausea and a feeling of fullness . The undigested fat leads to foul-smelling , fatty feces that are difficult to flush away . [ 3 ] Constipation is common . [ 28 ] At least 50 % of people with *$%^ adenocarcinoma have diabetes at the time of diagnosis . [ 2 ] While long-standing diabetes is a known risk factor for *$%^ *$%^ ( see Risk factors ) , the *$%^ can itself cause diabetes , in which case recent onset of diabetes could be considered an early sign of the disease . [ 29 ] People over 50 who develop diabetes have eight times the usual risk of developing *$%^ adenocarcinoma within three years , after which the relative risk declines . [ 3 ] Trousseau 's syndrome , in which blood clots form spontaneously in the portal blood vessels , the deep veins of the extremities , or the superficial veins anywhere on the body , may be associated with *$%^ *$%^ , and is found in about 10 % of cases . [ 5 ] Clinical depression has been reported in association with *$%^ *$%^ in some 10\u201320 % of cases , and can be a hindrance to optimal management . The depression sometimes appears before the diagnosis of *$%^ , suggesting that it may be brought on by the biology of the disease . [ 5 ] Other common manifestations of the disease include : weakness and tiring easily ; dry mouth ; sleep problems ; and a palpable abdominal mass . `` [ 28 ] The spread of *$%^ *$%^ to other organs ( metastasis ) may also cause symptoms . Typically , *$%^ adenocarcinoma first spreads to nearby lymph nodes , and later to the liver or to the peritoneal cavity , large intestine or lungs . [ 5 ] It is uncommon for it to spread to the bones or brain . [ 30 ] Cancers in the pancreas may also be secondary cancers that have spread from other parts of the body . This is uncommon , found in only about 2 % of cases of *$%^ *$%^ . Kidney *$%^ is by far the most common *$%^ to spread to the pancreas , followed by colorectal *$%^ , and then cancers of the skin , breast , and lung . Surgery may be performed on the pancreas in such cases , whether in hope of a cure or to alleviate symptoms . [ 31 ]", "Pancreatic cancer"], ["*$%^ is typically caused by irritation of the sciatic nerve . Spinal disc herniation pressing on one of the lumbar or sacral nerve roots is the primary cause of *$%^ , being present in about 90 % of cases . [ 3 ] *$%^ caused by pressure from a disc herniation and swelling of surrounding tissue can spontaneously subside if the tear in the disc heals and the pulposus extrusion and inflammation cease . Other compressive spinal causes include lumbar spinal stenosis , a condition in which the spinal canal ( the spaces the spinal cord runs through ) narrows and compresses the spinal cord , cauda equina , or sciatic nerve roots . This narrowing can be caused by bone spurs , spondylolisthesis , inflammation , or herniated disc , which decreases available space for the spinal cord , thus pinching and irritating nerves from the spinal cord that travel to the sciatic nerves . Piriformis syndrome is a controversial condition that , depending on the analysis , varies from a `` very rare '' cause to contributing to up to 8 % of low back or buttock pain . [ 7 ] In 17 % of the population , the sciatic nerve runs through the piriformis muscle rather than beneath it . When the muscle shortens or spasms due to trauma or overuse , it is posited that this causes compression of the sciatic nerve . [ 7 ] It has colloquially been referred to as `` wallet *$%^ '' since a wallet carried in a rear hip pocket compresses the buttock muscles and sciatic nerve when the bearer sits down . Piriformis syndrome causes *$%^ when the nerve root is normal . [ 8 ] [ 9 ] *$%^ may also occur during pregnancy as a result of the weight of the fetus pressing on the sciatic nerve during sitting or during leg spasms . While most cases do not directly harm the fetus or the mother , indirect harm may come from the numbing effect on the legs , which can cause loss of balance and falling . There is no standard treatment for pregnancy-induced *$%^ . [ 10 ] *$%^ can also be caused by tumours impinging on the spinal cord or the nerve roots . [ 3 ] Severe back pain extending to the hips and feet , loss of bladder or bowel control , or muscle weakness may result from spinal tumours or cauda equina syndrome . Trauma to the spine , such as from a car accident , may also lead to *$%^ .", "Sciatica"], ["Signs include the spontaneous formation of bruises ( *$%^ ) and petechiae ( tiny bruises ) , especially on the extremities , bleeding from the nostrils and/or gums , and menorrhagia ( excessive menstrual bleeding ) , any of which may occur if the platelet count is below 20,000 per \u03bcl . [ 1 ] A very low count ( < 10,000 per \u03bcl ) may result in the spontaneous formation of hematomas ( blood masses ) in the mouth or on other mucous membranes . Bleeding time from minor lacerations or abrasions is usually prolonged . Serious and possibly fatal complications due to extremely low counts ( < 5,000 per \u03bcl ) include subarachnoid or intracerebral hemorrhage ( bleeding inside the skull or brain ) , lower gastrointestinal bleeding or other internal bleeding . An ITP patient with an extremely low count is vulnerable to internal bleeding caused by blunt abdominal trauma , as might be experienced in a motor vehicle crash . These complications are not likely when the platelet count is above 20,000 per \u03bcl .", "Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura"], ["*$%^ is thought to result from failure of the urinary channel to completely tubularize to the end of the penis . The cause of *$%^ is not known . Most often , it is the only abnormal finding , although in about 10 % of cases *$%^ may be part of a syndrome with multiple abnormalities .

Symptoms typically develop 9\u201315 days after exposure , [ 3 ] but may occur as early as one day . [ 4 ] Symptoms are caused by Giardia organisms infecting the cells of the duodenum and jejunum of the small intestine [ 3 ] and blocking nutrient absorption . Most people are asymptomatic ; only about a third of infected people exhibit symptoms . If the infection is not treated , these symptoms may last for six weeks or more . Symptomatic infections are well recognized as causing lactose intolerance , [ 5 ] which , while usually temporary , may become permanent . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] Although hydrogen breath tests indicate poorer rates of carbohydrate absorption in those asymptomatically infected , such tests are not diagnostic of infection . [ 8 ] It has been suggested that these observations are explained by symptomatic giardia infection allowing for the overgrowth of other bacteria .

It is common to find that most people are infected by a small number of worms , while a small number of people are heavily infected , something that is characteristic of many worm infections . [ 1 ] [ 11 ] Clinical features depend on the affected body site . As larval stages travel through the body , they may cause visceral damage , peritonitis and inflammation , enlargement of the liver or spleen , and an inflammation of the lungs . Pulmonary manifestations take place during larval migration and may present as Loeffler 's syndrome , a transient respiratory illness associated with blood eosinophilia and pulmonary infiltrates with radiographic shadowing . [ 12 ] The worms can occasionally cause intestinal blockage when large numbers get tangled into a bolus or they may migrate from the small intestine , which may require surgery . More than 796 Ascaris lumbricoides worms weighing up to 550 g [ 19 ounces ] were recovered at autopsy from a 2-year-old South African girl . The worms had caused torsion and gangrene of the ileum , which was interpreted as the cause of death . [ 14 ] Bowel obstruction may occur in up to 0.2 per 1000 per year . [ 1 ] Sometimes the worm blocks the Ampulla of Vater or goes into the main pancreatic duct resulting in acute pancreatitis with raised serum levels of Amylase and Lipase . Occasionally they can travel through the billiary tree and even into the gallbladder causing acute cholangitis or acute cholecystitis . *$%^ may result in allergies to shrimp and dustmites due to the shared antigen , tropomyosin ; this has not been confirmed in the laboratory . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] The worms in the intestine may cause malabsorption and anorexia which contribute to malnutrition . [ 17 ] The malabsorption may be due to a loss of brush border enzymes , erosion and flattening of the villi , and inflammation of the lamina propria .

[ 19 ]", "Ascariasis"], ["Swelling ( especially in the hands and face ) was originally considered an important sign for a diagnosis of preeclampsia . However , because swelling is a common occurrence in pregnancy , its utility as a distinguishing factor in preeclampsia is not high . Pitting edema ( unusual swelling , particularly of the hands , feet , or face , notable by leaving an indentation when pressed on ) can be significant , and should be reported to a health care provider . In general , none of the signs of preeclampsia are specific , and even convulsions in pregnancy are more likely to have causes other than eclampsia in modern practice . Further , a symptom such as epigastric pain may be misinterpreted as heartburn . Diagnosis , therefore , depends on finding a coincidence of several preeclamptic features , the final proof being their regression after delivery .", "Pre-eclampsia"], ["The symptoms are like those associated with many other febrile diseases , but with emphasis on muscular pain and sweating . The duration of the disease can vary from a few weeks to many months or even years . In the first stage of the disease , septicaemia occurs and leads to the classic triad of undulant fevers , sweating ( often with characteristic smell , likened to wet hay ) , and migratory arthralgia and myalgia ( joint and muscle pain ) . Blood tests characteristically reveal leukopenia and anemia , show some elevation of AST and ALT , and demonstrate positive Bengal Rose and Huddleston reactions . This complex is , at least in Portugal , Israel , and Jordan , known as Malta fever . During episodes of Malta fever , melitococcemia ( presence of brucellae in blood ) can usually be demonstrated by means of blood culture in tryptose medium or Albini medium . If untreated , the disease can give origin to focalizations or become chronic . The focalizations of *$%^ occur usually in bones and joints and spondylodiscitis of the lumbar spine accompanied by sacroiliitis is very characteristic of this disease . Orchitis is also common in men . Diagnosis of *$%^ relies on : Demonstration of the agent : blood cultures in tryptose broth , bone marrow cultures .

Signs and symptoms of *$%^ include the following : [ 4 ] Chest pain ( often described as `` stabbing '' in character ) Congestive heart failure ( leading to swelling , shortness of breath and liver congestion ) Palpitations ( due to abnormal heart rhythms ) Sudden death ( in young adults , *$%^ causes up to 20 % of all cases of sudden death ) [ 5 ] Fever ( especially when infectious , e.g . in rheumatic fever ) Symptoms in infants and toddlers tend to be more nonspecific , with generalized malaise , poor appetite , abdominal pain , and/or chronic cough . Later stages of the illness will present with respiratory symptoms with increased work of breathing , and is often mistaken for asthma . Since *$%^ is often due to a viral illness , many patients give a history of symptoms consistent with a recent viral infection , including fever , rash , diarrhea , joint pains , and easily becoming tired . *$%^ is often associated with pericarditis , and many people with *$%^ present with signs and symptoms that suggest *$%^ and pericarditis at the same time .", "Myocarditis"], ["People often have few or no symptoms . [ 1 ] They may get occasional muscular weakness , muscle spasms , tingling sensations , or excessive urination . [ 1 ] High blood pressure , manifestations of muscle cramps ( due to hyperexcitability of neurons secondary to low blood calcium ) , muscle weakness ( due to hypoexcitability of skeletal muscles secondary to hypokalemia ) , and headaches ( due to low blood potassium or high blood pressure ) may be seen . Secondary hyperaldosteronism is often related to decreased cardiac output which is associated with elevated renin levels .", "Primary aldosteronism"], ["The signs and symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ often appear gradually , with peak onset being between 20 and 30 years of age . [ 4 ] The initial symptoms are usually a chronic dull pain in the lower back or gluteal region combined with stiffness of the lower back . [ 5 ] Individuals often experience pain and stiffness that awakens them in the early morning hours . [ 6 ] As the disease progresses , loss of spinal mobility and chest expansion , with limitation of anterior flexion , lateral flexion , and extension of the lumbar spine , are seen . Systemic features are common , with weight loss , fever , or fatigue often present . [ 7 ] Pain is often severe at rest , but improves with physical activity . However , many experience inflammation and pain to varying degrees regardless of rest and movement . AS can occur in any part of the spine or the entire spine , often with pain referred to one or the other buttock or the back of the thigh from the sacroiliac joint . Arthritis in the hips and shoulders may also occur . When the condition presents before the age of 18 , it is relatively likely to cause pain and swelling of large limb joints , particularly the knee . In prepubescent cases , pain and swelling may also manifest in the ankles and feet , where heel spurs may also develop . Less commonly ectasia of the sacral nerve root sheaths may occur . About 40 % of people with AS will also experience inflammation of the anterior chamber of the eye , causing eye pain , redness , floaters and sensitivity to light . This is thought to be due to the association that both AS and uveitis have with the inheritance of the HLA-B27 antigen . Inflammation of the prostate occurs with increased frequency in men . Cardiovascular involvement may include inflammation of the aorta , aortic valve insufficiency or disturbances of the heart 's electrical conduction system . Lung involvement is characterized by progressive fibrosis of the upper portion of the lung .", "Ankylosing spondylitis"], ["The mean age of patients who present with *$%^ is 41 years . The acute form usually develops over the course of several days , with pain and swelling frequently in only one testis , which will hang low in the scrotum . [ 5 ] There will often be a recent history of dysuria or urethral discharge . [ 5 ] Fever is also a common symptom . In the chronic version , the patient may have painful point tenderness but may or may not have an irregular epididymis upon palpation , though palpation may reveal an indurated epididymis . A scrotal ultrasound may reveal problems with the epididymis , but such an ultrasound may also show nothing unusual . The majority of patients who present with chronic *$%^ have had symptoms for over five years . [ 3 ] : p.311", "Epididymitis"], ["The main symptom is pain , causing loss of ability and often stiffness . `` Pain '' is generally described as a sharp ache or a burning sensation in the associated muscles and tendons . OA can cause a crackling noise ( called `` crepitus '' ) when the affected joint is moved or touched and people may experience muscle spasms and contractions in the tendons . Occasionally , the joints may also be filled with fluid . [ 8 ] Some people report increased pain associated with cold temperature , high humidity , and/or a drop in barometric pressure , but studies have had mixed results . [ 9 ] OA commonly affects the hands , feet , spine , and the large weight bearing joints , such as the hips and knees , although in theory , any joint in the body can be affected . As OA progresses , the affected joints appear larger , are stiff and painful , and usually feel better with gentle use but worse with excessive or prolonged use , thus distinguishing it from rheumatoid arthritis . In smaller joints , such as at the fingers , hard bony enlargements , called Heberden 's nodes ( on the distal interphalangeal joints ) and/or Bouchard 's nodes ( on the proximal interphalangeal joints ) , may form , and though they are not necessarily painful , they do limit the movement of the fingers significantly . OA at the toes leads to the formation of bunions , rendering them red or swollen . Some people notice these physical changes before they experience any pain . OA is the most common cause of a joint effusion of the knee . [ 10 ]", "Osteoarthritis"], ["*$%^ ( from Greek \u03ba\u03c5\u03c6\u03cc\u03c2 kyphos , a hump ) refers to the abnormally excessive convex kyphotic curvature of the spine as it occurs in the thoracic and sacral regions . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] ( Inward concave curving of the cervical and lumbar regions of the spine is called lordosis . ) *$%^ can be called roundback or Kelso 's hunchback . It can result from degenerative diseases such as arthritis ; developmental problems , most commonly Scheuermann 's disease ; osteoporosis with compression fractures of the vertebra ; Multiple myeloma or trauma . A normal thoracic spine extends from the 1st to the 12th vertebra and should have a slight kyphotic angle , ranging from 20\u00b0 to 45\u00b0 . When the `` roundness '' of the upper spine increases past 45\u00b0 it is called *$%^ or `` hyperkyphosis '' . Scheuermann 's *$%^ is the most classic form of hyperkyphosis and is the result of wedged vertebrae that develop during adolescence . The cause is not currently known and the condition appears to be multifactorial and is seen more frequently in males than females . [ 3 ] In the sense of a deformity , it is the pathological curving of the spine , where parts of the spinal column lose some or all of their lordotic profile . This causes a bowing of the back , seen as a slouching posture . While most cases of *$%^ are mild and only require routine monitoring , serious cases can be debilitating . High degrees of *$%^ can cause severe pain and discomfort , breathing and digestion difficulties , cardiovascular irregularities , neurological compromise and , in the more severe cases , significantly shortened life spans . These types of high-end curves typically do not respond well to conservative treatment and almost always warrant spinal fusion surgery , which can successfully restore the body 's natural degree of curvature . The Cobb angle is the preferred method of measuring *$%^ .", "Kyphosis"], ["Although *$%^ itself is asymptomatic , longstanding elevation of serum cholesterol can lead to atherosclerosis . [ 7 ] Over a period of decades , chronically elevated serum cholesterol contributes to formation of atheromatous plaques in the arteries . This can lead to progressive stenosis ( narrowing ) or even complete occlusion ( blockage ) of the involved arteries . Alternatively smaller plaques may rupture and cause a clot to form and obstruct blood flow . [ 8 ] A sudden occlusion of a coronary artery results in a myocardial infarction or heart attack . An occlusion of an artery supplying the brain can cause a stroke . If the development of the stenosis or occlusion is gradual blood supply to the tissues and organs slowly diminishes until organ function becomes impaired . At this point that tissue ischemia ( restriction in blood supply ) may manifest as specific symptoms . For example , temporary ischemia of the brain ( commonly referred to as a transient ischemic attack ) may manifest as temporary loss of vision , dizziness and impairment of balance , aphasia ( difficulty speaking ) , paresis ( weakness ) and paresthesia ( numbness or tingling ) , usually on one side of the body . Insufficient blood supply to the heart may manifest as chest pain , and ischemia of the eye may manifest as transient visual loss in one eye . Insufficient blood supply to the legs may manifest as calf pain when walking , while in the intestines it may present as abdominal pain after eating a meal . [ 1 ] [ 9 ] Some types of *$%^ lead to specific physical findings . For example , familial *$%^ ( Type IIa hyperlipoproteinemia ) may be associated with xanthelasma palpebrarum ( yellowish patches underneath the skin around the eyelids ) , [ 10 ] arcus senilis ( white or gray discoloration of the peripheral cornea ) , [ 11 ] and xanthomata ( deposition of yellowish cholesterol-rich material ) of the tendons , especially of the fingers .

Some individuals with *$%^ may experience external bleeding such as nosebleeds , and/or bleeding gums . Some women may have heavier or longer periods or breakthrough bleeding . Bruising , particularly purpura in the forearms , may be caused by spontaneous bleeding under the skin . Petechia ( pinpoint bleeds in the skin and mucous membranes ) , may occur on feet and legs . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Eliciting a full medical history is vital to ensure the low platelet count is not due to a secondary process . It is also important to ensure that the other blood cell types , such as red blood cells and white blood cells , are not also suppressed . [ 4 ] Painless , round and pinpoint ( 1 to 3 mm in diameter ) petechiae usually appear and fade , and sometimes group to form ecchymoses . Larger than petechiae , ecchymoses are purple , blue or yellow-green areas of skin that vary in size and shape . They can occur anywhere on the body . [ 4 ] A person with this disease may also complain of malaise , fatigue and general weakness ( with or without accompanying blood loss ) . In acquired *$%^ , the patient 's history may include the use of one or several offending drugs . Inspection typically reveals evidence of bleeding ( petechiae or ecchymoses ) , along with slow , continuous bleeding from any injuries or wounds . Adults may have large , blood-filled bullae in the mouth . [ 6 ] If the person 's platelet count is between 30,000 and 50,000/mm3 , bruising with minor trauma may be expected ; if it is between 15,000 and 30,000/mm3 , spontaneous bruising will be seen ( mostly on the arms and legs ) .

Rates of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ are much higher in relatives of individuals with schizophrenia than in the relatives of people with other mental illnesses or in people without mentally ill relatives . Technically speaking , *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ may also be considered an `` extended phenotype '' that helps geneticists track the familial or genetic transmission of the genes that are implicated in schizophrenia . [ 6 ] There is now evidence to suggest that parenting styles , early separation , trauma/maltreatment history ( especially early childhood neglect ) can lead to the development of *$%^ traits . [ 7 ] [ 8 ] Over time , children learn to interpret social cues and respond appropriately but for unknown reasons this process does not work well for people with this *$%^ .

[ 10 ] *$%^ *$%^ disorders are characterized by a common attentional impairment in various degrees . [ 11 ] A study suggested that attention deficits could serve as a marker of biological susceptibility to *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ . [ 11 ] The reason is that an individual who has difficulties taking in information may find it difficult in complicated social situations where interpersonal cues and attentive communications are essential for quality interaction . This might eventually cause the individual to withdraw from most social interactions , thus leading to asociality . [ 11 ]", "Schizotypal personality disorder"], ["The most common symptoms are diarrhea , abdominal pain , weight loss , and joint pains . The joint pains may be due to migratory non-deforming arthritis , which may occur many years before any digestive tract symptoms develop ; they tend to involve the large joints but can occur in any pattern and tend not to damage the joint surface to the point that the joint becomes deformed . Fever and chills occur in a small proportion of people . [ 4 ] In its more advanced form , malabsorption ( insufficient absorption of nutrients from the diet ) leads to wasting and the enlargement of lymph nodes in the abdomen . Neurological symptoms ( discussed below ) are more common in those with severe abdominal *$%^ . Chronic malabsorptive diarrhea leads to the poor absorption of fat , causing steatorrhea ( fatty , offensive stool ) , flatulence , and abdominal distension . Protein-losing enteropathy may also occur , causing depletion of albumin , a blood protein , which may lead to peripheral edema caused by the lowered oncotic pressures . [ 4 ] Darkening of the skin occurs in almost half ; some also have skin nodules . Various eye problems , such as uveitis , may occur ; this is typically associated with deteriorating vision and pain in the affected eye . Endocarditis ( infection of the heart valve ) has been reported in a small number of cases , sometimes in people with no other symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ ; this is typically noticed as breathlessness and leg swelling due to fluid accumulation as the heart is unable to pump fluid through the body .

In adults , the vertebrae and the pelvis are most commonly affected . Acute *$%^ almost invariably occurs in children . When adults are affected , it may be because of compromised host resistance due to debilitation , intravenous drug abuse , infectious root-canaled teeth , or other disease or drugs ( e.g. , immunosuppressive therapy ) . *$%^ is a secondary complication in 1\u20133 % of patients with pulmonary tuberculosis . [ 1 ] In this case , the bacteria , in general , spread to the bone through the circulatory system , first infecting the synovium ( due to its higher oxygen concentration ) before spreading to the adjacent bone . [ 1 ] In tubercular *$%^ , the long bones and vertebrae are the ones that tend to be affected . [ 1 ] Staphylococcus aureus is the organism most commonly isolated from all forms of *$%^ . [ 1 ] Bloodstream-sourced *$%^ is seen most frequently in children , and nearly 90 % of cases are caused by Staphylococcus aureus . In infants , S. aureus , Group B streptococci ( most common [ 3 ] ) and Escherichia coli are commonly isolated ; in children from one to 16 years of age , S. aureus , Streptococcus pyogenes , and Haemophilus influenzae are common . In some subpopulations , including intravenous drug users and splenectomized patients , Gram-negative bacteria , including enteric bacteria , are significant pathogens . [ 4 ] The most common form of the disease in adults is caused by injury exposing the bone to local infection . Staphylococcus aureus is the most common organism seen in *$%^ , seeded from areas of contiguous infection . But anaerobes and Gram-negative organisms , including Pseudomonas aeruginosa , E. coli , and Serratia marcescens , are also common . Mixed infections are the rule rather than the exception . [ 4 ] Systemic mycotic ( fungal ) infections may also cause *$%^ . The two most common are Blastomyces dermatitidis and Coccidioides immitis . In *$%^ involving the vertebral bodies , about half the cases are due to S. aureus , and the other half are due to tuberculosis ( spread hematogenously from the lungs ) . Tubercular *$%^ of the spine was so common before the initiation of effective antitubercular therapy , it acquired a special name , Pott 's disease . The Burkholderia cepacia complex has been implicated in vertebral *$%^ in intravenous drug users . [ 5 ]", "Osteomyelitis"], ["The physical manifestations of *$%^ *$%^ are due to the formation of hamartia ( malformed tissue such as the cortical tubers ) , hamartomas ( benign growths such as facial angiofibroma and subependymal nodules ) and , very rarely , cancerous hamartoblastomas . The effect of these on the brain leads to neurological symptoms such as seizures , intellectual disability , developmental delay and behavioral problems . Symptoms also include trouble in school and concentration problems . About 50 % of people with TSC have learning difficulties ranging from mild to significant , [ 2 ] and studies have reported that between 25 % and 61 % of affected individuals meet the diagnostic criteria for autism , with an even higher proportion showing features of a broader pervasive developmental disorder . [ 3 ] A 2008 study reported self-injurious behavior in 10 % of people with TSC . [ 4 ] Other conditions , such as ADHD , aggression , behavioral outbursts and OCD can also occur . Lower IQ is associated with more brain involvement on MRI . Three types of brain tumours may be associated with TSC : Giant cell astrocytoma : ( grows and blocks the cerebrospinal fluid ( CSF ) flow , leading to dilatation of ventricles causing headache and vomiting ) Cortical tubers : after which the disease is named . Sub-ependymal nodules : form in the walls of ventricles . Classic intracranial manifestations of *$%^ *$%^ include subependymal nodules and cortical/subcortical tubers . [ 5 ] The tubers are typically triangular in configuration , with the apex pointed towards the ventricles , and are thought to represent foci of abnormal neuronal migration . The T2 signal abnormalities may subside in adulthood , but will still be visible on histopathological analysis . On magnetic resonance imaging , TSC patients can exhibit other signs consistent with abnormal neuron migration such as radial white matter tracts hyperintense on T2WI and heterotopic gray matter . Subependymal nodules are composed of abnormal , swollen glial cells and bizarre multinucleated cells which are indeterminate for glial or neuronal origin . There is no interposed neural tissue . These nodules have a tendency to calcify as the patient ages . A nodule that markedly enhances and enlarges over time should be considered suspicious for transformation into a subependymal giant cell astrocytoma ( SEGA ) . A SEGA typically develops in the region of the foramen of Monro , in which case it is at risk of developing an obstructive hydrocephalus . A variable degree of ventricular enlargement , either obstructive ( e.g . by a subependymal nodule in the region of the foramen of Monro ) or idiopathic in nature . Between 60 and 80 % of TSC patients have benign tumors ( once thought hamartomatous , but now considered true neoplasms ) of the kidneys called angiomyolipomas ( AML ) frequently causing hematuria . These tumors are composed of vascular ( angio\u2013 ) , smooth muscle ( \u2013myo\u2013 ) , and fat ( \u2013lip- ) tissue . Although benign , an AML larger than 4 cm is at risk for a potentially catastrophic hemorrhage either spontaneously or with minimal trauma . AMLs are found in about 1 in 300 people without TSC . However , those are usually solitary , whereas in TSC they are commonly multiple and bilateral . Approximately 20-30 % of people with TSC will have renal cysts , causing few problems . However , 2 % may also have autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease . Very rare ( < 1 % ) problems include renal cell carcinoma and oncocytomas ( benign adenomatous hamartoma ) . Patients with TSC can develop progressive replacement of the lung parenchyma with multiple cysts . This process is identical to another disease called lymphangioleiomyomatosis ( LAM ) . Recent genetic analysis has shown that the proliferative bronchiolar smooth muscle in *$%^ sclerosis-related LAM is monoclonal metastasis from a coexisting renal angiomyolipoma . There have been cases of TSC-related LAM recurring following lung transplant . [ 6 ] Rhabdomyomas are benign tumors of striated muscle . A cardiac rhabdomyoma can be discovered using echocardiography in approximately 50 % of people with TSC . However , the incidence in the newborn may be as high as 90 % and in adults as low as 20 % . These tumors grow during the second half of pregnancy and regress after birth . Many will disappear entirely . Alternatively , the tumor size remains constant as the heart grows , which has much the same effect . Problems due to rhabdomyomas include obstruction , arrhythmia and a murmur . Such complications occur almost exclusively during pregnancy or within the child 's first year . Prenatal ultrasound , performed by an obstetric sonographer specializing in cardiology , can detect a rhabdomyoma after 20 weeks . This rare tumour is a strong indicator of TSC in the child , especially if there is a family history of TSC . Some form of dermatological sign will be present in 96 % of individuals with TSC . Most cause no problems but are helpful in diagnosis . Some cases may cause disfigurement , necessitating treatment . The most common skin abnormalities include : Facial angiofibromas ( `` adenoma sebaceum '' ) : A rash of reddish spots or bumps , which appear on the nose and cheeks in a butterfly distribution . They consist of blood vessels and fibrous tissue . This potentially socially embarrassing rash starts to appear during childhood and can be removed using dermabrasion or laser treatment . Periungual fibromas : Also known as Koenen 's tumors , these are small fleshy tumors that grow around and under the toenails or fingernails and may need to be surgically removed if they enlarge or cause bleeding . These are very rare in childhood but common by middle age . They are generally more common on toes than on \ufb01ngers , develop at 15\u201329 years and are more common in women than in men . They can be induced by nail-bed trauma . Hypomelanic macules ( `` ash leaf spots '' ) : White or lighter patches of skin that may appear anywhere on the body and are caused by a lack of melanin . These are usually the only visible sign of TSC at birth . In fair-skinned individuals a Wood 's lamp ( ultraviolet light ) may be required to see them . Forehead plaques : Raised , discolored areas on the forehead . Shagreen patches : Areas of thick leathery skin that are dimpled like an orange peel , pigmented and usually found on the lower back or nape of the neck . They can also be scattered across the trunk or thighs . The frequency of these lesions rises with age . Other skin features are not unique to individuals with TSC , including molluscum fibrosum or skin tags , which typically occur across the back of the neck and shoulders , caf\u00e9 au lait spots or flat brown marks , and poliosis , a tuft or patch of white hair on the scalp or eyelids . Retinal lesions , called astrocytic hamartomas ( or `` phakomas '' ) , which appear as a greyish or yellowish-white lesion in the back of the globe on the ophthalmic examination . Astrocytic hamartomas can calcify , and they are in the differential diagnosis of a calcified globe mass on a CT scan . Non-retinal lesions associated with TSC include Coloboma Angiofibromas of the eyelids Papilledema ( related to hydrocephalus ) Individuals with *$%^ *$%^ may experience none or all of the clinical signs discussed above .

People with the mildest cases have no symptoms other than faint , tell-tale `` mosaic lines '' between the Achilles tendons and the calf muscles . Severe cases , although rare , do exist . Severe cases entail the buildup of scales everywhere , with areas of the body that have a concentration of sweat glands being least affected . Areas where the skin rubs against each other , such as the armpits , the groin , and the `` folded '' areas of the elbow and knees , are less affected .

[ 13 ] Early symptoms may include loss of precision muscle coordination ( sometimes first manifested in declining penmanship , frequent small injuries to the hands , and dropped items ) , cramping pain with sustained use , and trembling . Significant muscle pain and cramping may result from very minor exertions like holding a book and turning pages . It may become difficult to find a comfortable position for arms and legs with even the minor exertions associated with holding arms crossed causing significant pain similar to restless leg syndrome . Affected persons may notice trembling in the diaphragm while breathing , or the need to place hands in pockets , under legs while sitting or under pillows while sleeping to keep them still and to reduce pain . Trembling in the jaw may be felt and heard while lying down , and the constant movement to avoid pain may result in the grinding and wearing down of teeth , or symptoms similar to temporomandibular joint disorder . The voice may crack frequently or become harsh , triggering frequent throat clearing . Swallowing can become difficult and accompanied by painful cramping . [ citation needed ] Electrical sensors ( EMG ) inserted into affected muscle groups , while painful , can provide a definitive diagnosis by showing pulsating nerve signals being transmitted to the muscles even when they are at rest . The brain appears to signal portions of fibers within the affected muscle groups at a firing speed of about 10 Hz causing them to pulsate , tremble and contort . When called upon to perform an intentional activity , the muscles fatigue very quickly and some portions of the muscle groups do not respond ( causing weakness ) while other portions over-respond or become rigid ( causing micro-tears under load ) .

Recent findings have indicated that the neural structures responsible for eating changes in FTD include atrophy in the right ventral insula , striatum and orbitofrontal cortex on structural MRI voxel-based morphometry ( right hemisphere ) . [ 5 ] Executive function is the cognitive skill of planning and organizing . Most FTD patients become unable to perform skills that require complex planning or sequencing . [ 6 ] In addition to the characteristic cognitive dysfunction , a number of primitive reflexes known as frontal release signs are often able to be elicited . Usually the first of these frontal release signs to appear is the palmomental reflex which appears relatively early in the disease course whereas the palmar grasp reflex and rooting reflex appear late in the disease course . In rare cases , FTD can occur in patients with motor neuron disease ( MND ) ( typically amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ) .

The hallmark of GDM is increased insulin resistance . Pregnancy hormones and other factors are thought to interfere with the action of insulin as it binds to the insulin receptor . The interference probably occurs at the level of the cell signaling pathway behind the insulin receptor . [ 15 ] Since insulin promotes the entry of glucose into most cells , insulin resistance prevents glucose from entering the cells properly . As a result , glucose remains in the bloodstream , where glucose levels rise . More insulin is needed to overcome this resistance ; about 1.5-2.5 times more insulin is produced than in a normal pregnancy . [ 15 ] Insulin resistance is a normal phenomenon emerging in the second trimester of pregnancy , which in cases of GDM progresses thereafter to levels seen in a non-pregnant person with type 2 *$%^ . It is thought to secure glucose supply to the growing fetus . Women with GDM have an insulin resistance that they can not compensate for with increased production in the \u03b2-cells of the pancreas . Placental hormones , and to a lesser extent increased fat deposits during pregnancy , seem to mediate insulin resistance during pregnancy . Cortisol and progesterone are the main culprits , but human placental lactogen , prolactin and estradiol contribute , too . Multivariate stepwise regression analysis reveals that , in combination with other placental hormones , leptin , tumor necrosis factor alpha , and resistin are involved in the decrease in insulin resistance occurring during pregnancy , with tumor necrosis factor alpha named as the strongest independent predictor of insulin sensitivity in pregnancy . An inverse correlation with the changes in insulin sensitivity from the time before conception through late gestation accounts for about half of the variance in the decrease in insulin sensitivity during gestation : in other words , low levels or alteration of TNF alpha factors corresponds with a greater chance of , or predisposition to , insulin resistance or sensitivity . GABBE , STEVEN G ; sixth Edition page 890 . It is unclear why some women are unable to balance insulin needs and develop GDM ; however , a number of explanations have been given , similar to those in type 2 *$%^ : autoimmunity , single gene mutations , obesity , along with other mechanisms . [ 16 ] Though the clinical presentation of *$%^ *$%^ is well characterized , the biochemical mechanism behind the disease is not well known . One proposed biochemical mechanism involves insulin-producing \u03b2-cell adaptation controlled by the HGF/c-MET signaling pathway . \u03b2-cell adaption refers to the change that pancreatic islet cells undergo during pregnancy in response to maternal hormones in order to compensate for the increased physiological needs of mother and baby . These changes in the \u03b2-cells cause increased insulin secretion as a result of increased \u03b2-cell proliferation . [ 17 ] HGF/c-MET has also been implicated in \u03b2-cell regeneration , which suggests that HGF/c-MET may help increase \u03b2-cell mass in order to compensate for insulin needs during pregnancy . Recent studies support that loss of HGF/c-MET signaling results in aberrant \u03b2-cell adaptation . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] c-MET is a receptor tyrosine kinase ( RTK ) that is activated by its ligand , hepatocyte growth factor ( HGF ) , and is involved in the activation of several cellular processes . When HGF binds c-MET , the receptor homodimerizes and self-phosphorylates to form an SH2 recognition domain . The downstream pathways activated include common signaling molecules such as RAS and MAPK , which affect cell motility , cell motility , and cell cycle progression . [ 20 ] Studies have shown that HGF is an important signaling molecule in stress related situations where more insulin is needed . Pregnancy causes increased insulin resistance and so a higher insulin demand . The \u03b2-cells must compensate for this by either increasing insulin production or proliferating . If neither of the processes occur , then markers for *$%^ *$%^ are observed . It has been observed that pregnancy increases HGF levels , showing a correlation that suggests a connection between the signaling pathway and increased insulin needs . In fact , when no signaling is present , *$%^ *$%^ is more likely to occur . [ 18 ] The exact mechanism of HGF/c-MET regulated \u03b2-cell adaptation is not yet known but there are several hypotheses about how the signaling molecules contribute to insulin levels during pregnancy . c-MET may interact with FoxM1 , a molecule important in the cell cycle , as FOXM1 levels decrease when c-MET is not present . Additionally , c-MET may interact with p27 as the protein levels increase with c-MET is not present . Another hypothesis says that c-MET may control \u03b2-cell apoptosis because a lack of c-MET causes increases cell death but the signaling mechanisms have not been elucidated . [ 19 ] Although the mechanism of HGF/c-MET control of *$%^ *$%^ is not yet well understood , there is a strong correlation between the signaling pathway and the inability to produce an adequate amount of insulin during pregnancy and thus it may be the target for future diabetic therapies . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Because glucose travels across the placenta ( through diffusion facilitated by GLUT1 carrier ) , which is located in the syncytiotrophoblast on both the microvillus and basal membranes , these membranes may be the rate-limiting step in placental glucose transport . There is a two- to three-fold increase in the expression of syncytiotrophoblast glucose transporters with advancing gestation . Finally , the role of GLUT3/GLUT4 transport remains speculative . If the untreated *$%^ *$%^ fetus is exposed to consistently higher glucose levels , this leads to increased fetal levels of insulin ( insulin itself can not cross the placenta ) . The growth-stimulating effects of insulin can lead to excessive growth and a large body ( macrosomia ) . After birth , the high glucose environment disappears , leaving these newborns with ongoing high insulin production and susceptibility to low blood glucose levels ( hypoglycemia ) . [ 21 ]", "Gestational diabetes"], ["The main symptoms of *$%^ are the result of the low blood calcium level , which interferes with normal muscle contraction and nerve conduction . As a result , people with *$%^ can experience paresthesia , an unpleasant tingling sensation around the mouth and in the hands and feet , as well as muscle cramps and severe spasms known as `` tetany '' that affect the hands and feet . [ 2 ] Many also report a number of subjective symptoms such as fatigue , headaches , bone pain and insomnia . [ 1 ] Crampy abdominal pain may occur . [ 3 ] Physical examination of someone with hypocalcemia may show tetany , but it is also possible to provoke tetany of the facial muscles by tapping on the facial nerve ( a phenomenon known as Chvostek 's sign ) or by using the cuff of a sphygmomanometer to temporarily obstruct the blood flow to the arm ( a phenomenon known as Trousseau 's sign of latent tetany ) . [ 3 ] A number of medical emergencies can arise in people with low calcium levels . These are seizures , severe irregularities in the normal heart beat , as well as spasm of the upper part of the airways or the smaller airways known as the bronchi ( both potentially causing respiratory failure ) . [ 1 ]", "Hypoparathyroidism"], ["The clinical picture is often dominated by the underlying cause , eg postoperative state . The symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ result from the various disturbances of *$%^ function that are associated with the disease . Accumulation of urea and other nitrogen-containing substances in the bloodstream lead to a number of symptoms , such as fatigue , loss of appetite , headache , nausea and vomiting . [ 4 ] Marked increases in the potassium level can lead to irregularities in the heartbeat , which can be severe and life-threatening . [ 5 ] Fluid balance is frequently affected , though blood pressure can be high , low or normal . [ 6 ] . Pain in the flanks may be encountered in some conditions ( such as thrombosis of the renal blood vessels or inflammation of the *$%^ ) ; this is the result of stretching of the fibrous tissue capsule surrounding the *$%^ . [ 7 ] If the *$%^ *$%^ is the result of dehydration , there may be thirst as well as evidence of fluid depletion on physical examination . [ 7 ] Physical examination may also provide other clues as to the underlying cause of the *$%^ problem , such as a rash in interstitial nephritis ( or vasculitis ) and a palpable bladder in obstructive nephropathy . [ 7 ]", "Acute kidney injury"], ["The classic presentation ( in 40-50 % of the cases ) is episodic hematuria which usually starts within a day or two of a non-specific upper respiratory tract infection ( hence synpharyngitic ) as opposed to post-streptococcal glomerulonephritis which occurs some time ( weeks ) after initial infection . Less commonly gastrointestinal or urinary infection can be the inciting agent . All of these infections have in common the activation of mucosal defenses and hence *$%^ antibody production . Groin pain can also occur . The gross hematuria resolves after a few days , though microscopic hematuria may persist . These episodes occur on an irregular basis every few months and in most patients eventually subsides ( although it can take many years ) . Renal function usually remains normal , though rarely , acute kidney failure may occur ( see below ) . This presentation is more common in younger adults . A smaller proportion ( 20-30 % ) , usually the older population , have microscopic hematuria and proteinuria ( less than 2 gram/day ) . These patients may not have any symptoms and are only clinically found if a doctor decides to take a urine sample . Hence , the disease is more commonly diagnosed in situations where screening of urine is compulsory , e.g . schoolchildren in Japan . Very rarely ( 5 % each ) , the presenting history is : Nephrotic syndrome ( 3-3.5 grams of protein loss in the urine , associated with a poorer prognosis ) Acute kidney failure ( either as a complication of the frank hematuria , when it usually recovers , or due to rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis which often leads to chronic kidney failure ) Chronic kidney failure ( no previous symptoms , presents with anemia , hypertension and other symptoms of kidney failure , in people who probably had longstanding undetected microscopic hematuria and/or proteinuria ) A variety of systemic diseases are associated with *$%^ *$%^ such as liver failure , celiac disease , rheumatoid arthritis , reactive arthritis , ankylosing spondylitis and HIV . Diagnosis of *$%^ *$%^ and a search for any associated disease occasionally reveals such an underlying serious systemic disease .

Some HLA alleles have been suspected along with complement phenotypes as being genetic factors .", "IgA nephropathy"], ["*$%^ ( small vascular malformations ) may occur in the skin and mucosal linings of the nose and gastrointestinal tract . The most common problem is nosebleeds ( epistaxis ) , which happen frequently from childhood and affect about 90\u201395 % of people with HHT . Lesions on the skin and in the mouth bleed less often but may be considered cosmetically displeasing ; they affect about 80 % . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The skin lesions characteristically occur on the lips , the nose and the fingers , and on the skin of the face in sun-exposed areas . They appear suddenly , with the number increasing over time . [ 2 ] About 20 % are affected by symptomatic digestive tract lesions , although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms . These lesions may bleed intermittently , which is rarely significant enough to be noticed ( in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool ) , but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body , resulting in iron-deficiency anemia . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Arteriovenous malformation ( AVM , larger vascular malformations ) occur in larger organs , predominantly the lungs ( 50 % ) , liver ( 30\u201370 % ) and the brain ( 10 % ) , with a very small proportion ( < 1 % ) having AVMs in the spinal cord . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] Vascular malformations in the lungs may cause a number of problems . The lungs normally `` filter out '' bacteria and blood clots from the bloodstream ; AVMs bypass the capillary network of the lungs and allow these to migrate to the brain , where bacteria may cause a brain abscess and blood clots may lead to stroke . [ 1 ] HHT is the most common cause of lung AVMs : out of all people found to have lung AVMs , 70\u201380 % are due to HHT . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Bleeding from lung AVMs is relatively unusual , but may cause hemoptysis ( coughing up blood ) or hemothorax ( blood accumulating in the chest cavity ) . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] [ 4 ] Large vascular malformations in the lung allow oxygen-depleted blood from the right ventricle to bypass the alveoli , meaning that this blood does not have an opportunity to absorb fresh oxygen . This may lead to breathlessness . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] Large AVMs may lead to platypnea , difficulty in breathing that is more marked when sitting up compared to lying down ; this probably reflects changes in blood flow associated with positioning . [ 4 ] Very large AVMs cause a marked inability to absorb oxygen , which may be noted by cyanosis ( bluish discoloration of the lips and skin ) , clubbing of the fingernails ( often encountered in chronically low oxygen levels ) , and a humming noise over the affected part of the lung detectable by stethoscope . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] The symptoms produced by AVMs in the liver depend on the type of abnormal connection that they form between blood vessels . If the connection is between arteries and veins , a large amount of blood bypasses the body 's organs , for which the heart compensates by increasing the cardiac output . Eventually congestive cardiac failure develops ( `` high-output cardiac failure '' ) , with breathlessness and leg swelling among other problems . [ 1 ] [ 6 ] If the AVM creates a connection between the portal vein and the blood vessels of the liver , the result may be portal hypertension ( increased portal vein pressure ) , in which collateral blood vessels form in the esophagus ( esophageal varices ) , which may bleed violently ; furthermore , the increased pressure may give rise to fluid accumulation in the abdominal cavity ( ascites ) . If the flow in the AVM is in the other direction , portal venous blood flows directly into the veins rather than running through the liver ; this may lead to hepatic encephalopathy ( confusion due to portal waste products irritating the brain ) . Rarely , the bile ducts are deprived of blood , leading to severe cholangitis ( inflammation of the bile ducts ) . [ 1 ] [ 6 ] Liver AVMs are detectable in over 70 % of people with HHT , but only 10 % experience problems as a result . [ 2 ] In the brain , AVMs occasionally exert pressure , leading to headaches . They may also increase the risk of seizures , as would any abnormal tissue in the brain . Finally , hemorrhage from an AVM may lead to intracerebral hemorrhage ( bleeding into the brain ) , which causes any of the symptoms of stroke such as weakness in part of the body or difficulty speaking . If the bleeding occurs into the subarachnoid space ( subarachnoid hemorrhage ) , there is usually a severe , sudden headache and decreased level of consciousness and often weakness in part of the body . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] A very small proportion ( those affected by SMAD4 ( MADH4 ) mutations , see below ) have multiple benign polyps in the large intestine , which may bleed or transform into colorectal cancer . A similarly small proportion experiences pulmonary hypertension , a state in which the pressure in the lung arteries is increased , exerting pressure on the right side of the heart and causing peripheral edema ( swelling of the legs ) , fainting and attacks of chest pain . It has been observed that the risk of thrombosis ( particularly venous thrombosis , in the form of deep vein thrombosis or pulmonary embolism ) may be increased . There is a suspicion that those with HHT may have a mild immunodeficiency and are therefore at a slightly increased risk from infections .

Those patients report pain along with the contractions . *$%^ *$%^ disease often starts with nodules in the palm of the hand and it can extend to a cord in a finger .", "Dupuytren's contracture"], ["The hormones of the pituitary have different actions in the body , and the symptoms of *$%^ therefore depend on which hormone is deficient . The symptoms may be subtle and are often initially attributed to other causes . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] In most of the cases , three or more hormones are deficient . [ 6 ] The most common problem is insufficiency of follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) and/or luteinizing hormone ( LH ) leading to sex hormone abnormalities . Growth hormone deficiency is more common in people with an underlying tumor than those with other causes . [ 1 ] [ 6 ] Sometimes , there are additional symptoms that arise from the underlying cause ; for instance , if the *$%^ is due to a growth hormone-producing tumor , there may be symptoms of acromegaly ( enlargement of the hands and feet , coarse facial features ) , and if the tumor extends to the optic nerve or optic chiasm , there may be visual field defects . Headaches may also accompany pituitary tumors , [ 1 ] as well as pituitary apoplexy ( infarction or hemorrhage of a pituitary tumor ) and lymphocytic hypophysitis ( autoimmune inflammation of the pituitary ) . [ 7 ] Apoplexy , in addition to sudden headaches and rapidly worsening visual loss , may also be associated with double vision that results from compression of the nerves in the adjacent cavernous sinus that control the eye muscles . [ 8 ] Pituitary failure results in many changes in the skin , hair and nails as a result of the absence of pituitary hormone action on these sites . [ 9 ] Deficiency of all anterior pituitary hormones is more common than individual hormone deficiency . Deficiency of luteinizing hormone ( LH ) and follicle-stimulating hormone ( FSH ) , together referred to as the gonadotropins , leads to different symptoms in men and women . Women experience oligo- or amenorrhea ( infrequent/light or absent menstrual periods respectively ) and infertility . Men lose facial , scrotal and trunk hair , as well as suffering decreased muscle mass and anemia . Both sexes may experience a decrease in libido and loss of sexual function , and have an increased risk of osteoporosis ( bone fragility ) . Lack of LH/FSH in children is associated with delayed puberty . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] Growth hormone ( GH ) deficiency leads to a decrease in muscle mass , central obesity ( increase in body fat around the waist ) and impaired attention and memory . Children experience growth retardation and short stature . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] Adrenocorticotropic hormone ( ACTH ) deficiency leads to adrenal insufficiency , a lack of production of glucocorticoids such as cortisol by the adrenal gland . If the problem is chronic , symptoms consist of fatigue , weight loss , failure to thrive ( in children ) , delayed puberty ( in adolescents ) , hypoglycemia ( low blood sugar levels ) , anemia and hyponatremia ( low sodium levels ) . If the onset is abrupt , collapse , shock and vomiting may occur . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] ACTH deficiency is highly similar to primary Addison 's disease , which is cortisol deficiency as the result of direct damage to the adrenal glands ; the latter form , however , often leads to hyperpigmentation of the skin , which does not occur in ACTH deficiency . [ 10 ] Thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) deficiency leads to hypothyroidism ( lack of production of thyroxine ( T4 ) and triiodothyronine ( T3 ) in the thyroid ) . Typical symptoms are tiredness , intolerance to cold , constipation , weight gain , hair loss and slowed thinking , as well as a slowed heart rate and low blood pressure . In children , hypothyroidism leads to delayed growth and in extreme inborn forms to a syndrome called cretinism . [ 1 ] [ 5 ] Prolactin ( PRL ) plays a role in breastfeeding , and inability to breastfeed may point at abnormally low prolactin levels . [ 7 ] Antidiuretic hormone ( ADH ) deficiency leads to the syndrome of diabetes insipidus ( unrelated to diabetes mellitus ) : inability to concentrate the urine , leading to polyuria ( production of large amounts of clear urine ) that is low in solutes , dehydration and\u2014in compensation\u2014extreme thirst and constant need to drink ( polydipsia ) , as well as hypernatremia ( high sodium levels in the blood ) . [ 11 ] ADH deficiency may be masked if there is ACTH deficiency , with symptoms only appearing when cortisol has been replaced . [ 7 ] Oxytocin ( OXT ) deficiency generally causes few symptoms , as it is only required at the time of childbirth and breastfeeding .

Enlargement of the liver and spleen ( hepatosplenomegaly ) may cause reduced appetite , abdominal distension , and pain . Enlargement of the spleen ( splenomegaly ) may also cause low levels of platelets in the blood ( thrombocytopenia ) . Accumulation of sphingomyelin in the central nervous system ( including the cerebellum ) results in unsteady gait ( ataxia ) , slurring of speech ( dysarthria ) , and difficulty in swallowing ( dysphagia ) .

However , it is important that a full medical history be elicited to ensure that the increased platelet count is not due to a secondary process .

High platelet counts can occur in patients with polycythemia vera ( high red blood cell counts ) , and is an additional risk factor for complications .

Conversely , secondary *$%^ very rarely causes thrombotic complications . [ 5 ]", "Thrombocytosis"], ["The exact cause of *$%^ is unknown . [ 2 ] Triggers that cause episodes of flushing and blushing play a part in its development . Exposure to temperature extremes , strenuous exercise , heat from sunlight , severe sunburn , stress , anxiety , cold wind , and moving to a warm or hot environment from a cold one , such as heated shops and offices during the winter , can each cause the face to become flushed . [ 2 ] Certain foods and drinks can also trigger flushing , such as alcohol , foods and beverages containing caffeine ( especially hot tea and coffee ) , foods high in histamines , and spicy foods . [ 6 ] Medications and topical irritants have also been known to trigger *$%^ flares . Some acne and wrinkle treatments reported to cause *$%^ include microdermabrasion and chemical peels , as well as high dosages of isotretinoin , benzoyl peroxide , and tretinoin . Steroid-induced *$%^ is caused by the use of topical or nasal steroids . These steroids are often prescribed for seborrheic dermatitis . Dosage should be slowly decreased and not immediately stopped to avoid a flare-up . Richard Gallo and colleagues recently noticed that patients with *$%^ had high levels of the antimicrobial peptide cathelicidin [ 7 ] and elevated levels of stratum corneum tryptic enzymes ( SCTEs ) . Antibiotics have been used in the past to treat *$%^ , but they may only work because they inhibit some SCTEs . [ 8 ] Studies of *$%^ and Demodex mites have revealed that some people with *$%^ have increased numbers of the mite , [ 6 ] especially those with steroid-induced *$%^ . When large numbers are present , they may play a role along with other triggers . On other occasions , demodicidosis ( mange ) is a separate condition that may have `` rosacea-like '' appearances . [ 9 ] Demodex mites have also been implicated in *$%^ in that it may be caused by a reaction to bacteria in the mite 's feces . [ 10 ] [ medical citation needed ] Small intestinal bacterial overgrowth ( SIBO ) was demonstrated to have greater prevalence in *$%^ patients and its eradication led to skin lesion improvement in two studies , and in *$%^ patients who were SIBO negative , the antibiotic therapy had no effect on the skin lesions .

These may bleed , leading to blood in the stool . If the blood is not visible , it is still possible for the patient to develop anemia due to gradually developing iron deficiency . If malignancy develops , this may present with weight loss , altered bowel habit , or even metastasis to the liver or elsewhere . FAP can also develop 'silently ' in some individuals , giving few or no signs until it has developed into advanced colorectal cancer . Because *$%^ *$%^ develops very gradually over years , and can also manifest in an 'attenuated ' form even slower , polyps resulting from FAP can lead to cancer developing at any point from adolescence to old age . Depending on the nature of the defect in the APC gene , and whether it is the full or attenuated form , *$%^ *$%^ may manifest as polyps in the bowel , or in the colon , or in the duodenal tract , or in any combination of these . Therefore an absence of polyps in , for example , the rectum , may not of itself be sufficient to confirm absence of polyps . It may be necessary to consider and visually examine other possible parts of the intestinal tract . Colonoscopy is preferred over sigmoidoscopy for this , as it provides better observation of the common right-side location of polyps .

This inflammation typically results in one or both of the nephrotic or nephritic syndromes . [ 2 ] :500 The nephrotic syndrome is characterised by the finding of edema in a person with increased protein in the urine and decreased protein in the blood , with increased fat in the blood . Inflammation that affects the cells surrounding the glomerulus , podocytes , increases the permeability to proteins , resulting in an increase in excreted proteins . When the amount of proteins excreted in the urine exceeds the liver 's ability to compensate , fewer proteins are detected in the blood - in particular albumin , which makes up the majority of circulating proteins . With decreased proteins in the blood , there is a decrease in the oncotic pressure of the blood . This results in edema , as the oncotic pressure in tissue remains the same . This is worsened by the secretion of the hormone Aldosterone by the adrenal gland , which is secreted in response to the decrease in circulating blood and causes sodium and water retention . Hyperlipidemia is thought to be a result of the increased activity of the liver . [ 3 ] :549 The nephritic syndrome is characterised by blood in the urine and a decrease in the amount of urine in the presence of hypertension . In this syndrome , inflammatory damage to cells lining the glomerulus are thought to result in destruction of the epithelial barrier , leading to blood being found in the urine . At the same time , reactive changes [ which ? ] may result in a decrease in kidney blood flow , resulting in a decrease in the production of urine . The renin-angiotensin system may be subsequently activated , because of the decrease in perfusion of juxtaglomerular apparatus , which may result in hypertension .

It is characterized by white lumps in the undersurface of the upper eyelid ( conjunctival follicles or lymphoid germinal centres ) and by non-specific inflammation and thickening often associated with papillae . Follicles may also appear at the junction of the cornea and the sclera ( limbal follicles ) . Active *$%^ will often be irritating and have a watery discharge .

[ 11 ] Photoaging leads to an accumulation of oncogenic changes , resulting in a proliferation of mutated keratinocytes that can manifest as AKs or other neoplastic growths .

The lesions are usually asymptomatic , but can be tender , itch , bleed , or produce a stinging or burning sensation .

They are usually 2-6mm in diameter but can sometimes reach several centimeters in diameter . [ 12 ] Hypertrophic ( or hyperkeratotic ) : Hypertrophic AKs ( HAKs ) appear as a thicker scale or rough papule or plaque , often adherent to an erythematous base . Classic AKs can progress to become HAKs , and HAKs themselves can be difficult to distinguish from malignant lesions . Atrophic : Atrophic AKs lack an overlying scale , and therefore appear as a nonpalpable change in color ( or macule ) . They are often smooth and red , and are less than 10mm in diameter . AK with cutaneous horn : A cutaneous horn is a keratinic projection with its height at least one-half of its diameter , often conical in shape . They can be seen in the setting of *$%^ *$%^ as a progression of an HAK , but are also present in other skin conditions . [ 12 ] 38\u201340 % of cutaneous horns represent AKs .

[ 4 ] :746", "Myelofibrosis"], ["Children born with *$%^ have a distinct appearance , otherwise known as the phenotype . The features of the phenotype are determined by which particular suture is closed . [ 6 ] The fusion of this suture causes a certain change in the shape of the skull ; a deformity of the skull . [ 6 ] Virchow\u2019s law dictates that , when premature suture closure occurs , growth of the skull typically is restricted perpendicularly to the fused suture and enhanced in a plane parallel to it , thus trying to provide space for the fast-growing brain . [ 7 ] Using this law , the pattern of skull deformity in *$%^ often may be predicted . [ 7 ] An illustrative example of this phenomenon is scaphocephaly ; the name providing a direct hint regarding the deformity of the skull . The literal meaning of the Greek derived word \u2018scaphocephaly\u2019 is boathead . A synonymous term is 'dolichocephaly ' ( the prefix dolicho- means elongated ) . [ 8 ] Premature sagittal suture closure restricts growth in a perpendicular plane , thus the head will not grow sideways and remain narrow . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] This is best seen in a view standing above the child looking downward at the top of the head . [ 11 ] Compensatory growth occurs forward at the coronal suture and backward at the lambdoid suture giving respectively a prominent forehead , called frontal bossing , and a prominent back portion of the head , called coning . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] When viewed from sideways the resulting shape of the head will look a bit like a boat . Trigonocephaly is a result from the premature closure of the metopic suture . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Using Virchow\u2019s law again to predict the resulting deformity , this fusion will result in a narrow forehead , which is even further emphasized by ridging of the suture . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Compensatory growth occurs at both the coronal sutures , thereby pushing the forehead forwards . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The resulting shape can best be assessed from a top view again , which will reveal a somewhat triangular form of the head . [ 11 ] Trigonocephaly is also a Greek derived word , which can be translated as triangular shaped head . A facial feature of metopic synostosis is hypotelorism ; in the frontal view , it can be seen that the width between the eyes is smaller than usual . [ 10 ] The Greek word plagios means skew . Plagiocephaly can be subclassified in Anterior Plagiocephaly and Posterior Plagiocephaly . Anterior plagiocephaly is a clinical description of unilateral coronal synostosis . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Children born with unilateral coronal synostosis develop due to compensatory mechanisms a skew head ; a plagiocephaly . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The sagittal suture \u2018divides\u2019 the coronal suture in two halves ; unilateral meaning that either the right side or the left side to the sagittal suture is fused . This fact immediately raises an important point . Unlike closure of the sagittal or the metopic suture , right and left are not the same in unilateral coronal synostosis . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] This asymmetry shows in the skull deformity , as well as in the facial deformity and the complications . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] This time , the skull deformity can only partly be predicted using Virchow\u2019s law . Growth is arrested in the plane perpendicular to the fused suture and the forehead is flattened , but only at the ipsilateral side of the head . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Ipsilateral indicates the same side of the head as where the suture is closed . Compensatory growth occurs in a parallel plane , as well as in a perpendicular plane . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] An increase in growth at the metopic and the sagittal suture accounts for the parallel plane and will result in bulging at the temporal fossa and an increase in width of the skull . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Compensatory growth in the perpendicular plane occurs on the side of the head with the patent coronal suture , the contralateral side . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Half of the forehead will bulge forwards as a result . Assessment of the skull from a top view shows asymmetry of the frontal bones , an increased width of the skull and a forward displacement of the ear at the ipsilateral side of the head . [ 11 ] Assessment of the skull from a frontal view will show asymmetrical features of the face , including a displacement of the chin point of the jaw and a deviation of the tip of the nose . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The chin point is located more to the contralateral side of the head , due to the ipsilateral forward displacement of the temporomandibular joint together with the ear . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] The tip of the nose will also point towards the contralateral side . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] Complications based on the skull deformation include malocclusion of the jaw and in as many as 90 % \u2014 a subtle form of \u2014 strabismus , the last being caused by the asymmetrical placement of the orbits . [ 10 ] Unilateral lambdoid synostosis is also called posterior plagiocephaly , indicating that this gives , just like unilateral coronal synostosis , a \u2018skew head\u2019 . The difference is that this time , the deformity mostly shows at the occiput . Remembering Virchow\u2019s law , restriction of growth will occur at the ipsilateral side of the head ; compensatory growth will occur at the contralateral side of the head . This growth pattern exerts an effect at the base of the skull , which is not even when the child is assessed from a point of view standing behind the child , as well as on the cervical spine , which shows a curvature . [ 12 ] In addition , an asymmetry of the ears can be seen , with the ear on the ipsilateral side placed further to the back . Also , again from a point of view standing behind the child , a bulging of the mastoid can be seen . [ 12 ] Minimal forehead asymmetries are typically seen . [ 10 ] Brachycephaly , or a \u2018short head\u2019 , is the result of a closure of both the coronal sutures . [ 10 ] Following Virchow\u2019s law , this will result in a child\u2019s head with a restriction of growth in the forward direction and in the backward direction ; recessed frontal bones and a flattened occiput . [ 10 ] Compensatory growth will occur sideways , due to the sagittal suture , and upwards , due to the lambdoid sutures . [ 10 ] Oxycephaly , also known as turricephaly and high-head syndrome , is a type of cephalic disorder . This is a term sometimes used to describe the premature closure of the coronal suture plus any other suture , like the lambdoid suture , The word pansynostosis is also Greek derived and can be translated as \u2018all one bone\u2019 , indicating that all of the sutures are closed . [ 13 ] In general practice , the term is used to describe the children with three or more cranial sutures closed . [ 13 ] Pansynostosis can present in several ways . The appearance can be the same as that seen with primary microcephaly : a markedly small head , but with normal proportions . [ 14 ] However , pansynostosis can also appear as a Kleeblattsch\u00e4del ( cloverleaf skull ) , which presents with bulging of the different bones of the cranial vault . [ 14 ] The condition is associated with thanatophoric dwarfism . Apert\u2019s syndrome : an abnormal skull shape , small upper jaw , and fusion of the fingers and toes . Crouzon\u2019s syndrome : A craniofacial birth abnormalities with bilateral coronal suture fusion . Anterior and posterior of skull shortness , flat cheek bones and a flat nose are their features . Pfeiffer 's syndrome : abnormalities of the skull , hands , and feet wide-set , bulging eyes , an underdeveloped upper jaw , beaked nose . Pierre Robin syndrome : abnormalities in the facial skeleton , resulting in a smaller than normal lower jaw or receding chin . The tongue often falls back in the pharynges causing difficulty breathing . Saethe-Chotzen syndrome : short or broad head . the eyes may be spaced wide apart and have palpebral ptosis ( droopy eyelids ) , and fingers may be abnormally short and webbed . [ 15 ] [ 16 ] Not all cranial abnormalities seen in children with *$%^ are solely a consequence of the premature fusion of a cranial suture . This is especially true in the cases with syndromic *$%^ . Findings include elevation of the intracranial pressure ; obstructive sleep apnoea ( OSA ) ; abnormalities in the skull base and neurobehavioral impairment . [ 10 ] When the ICP is elevated the following symptomes may occur : vomiting , visual disturbance , bulging of the anterior fontanel , altered mental status , papilledema and headache . [ 17 ] The main risks of prolonged elevated intracranial pressure may include cognitive impairment and impaired vision through prolonged papilledema . [ 14 ] These are the main reasons why fundoscopy should be performed during the physical examination of children with *$%^ . [ 14 ] The causes of an elevation of the intracranial pressure are best understood using the Monro-Kellie doctrine . [ 18 ] The Monro-Kellie doctrine reduces the cranial vault to a box with rigid walls . [ 18 ] This box contains three elements : brain , intracranial blood and cerebrospinal fluid . [ 18 ] The sum of volumes of these three elements is constant . [ 18 ] An increase in one should cause a decrease in one or both of the remaining two , thereby preventing an elevation of the intracranial pressure . [ 18 ] A compensatory mechanism involves the movement of cerebrospinal fluid from the cranial vault towards the spinal cord . [ 18 ] The volume of blood in the cranial vault is auto-regulated by the brain , and will therefore not decrease that easily . [ 18 ] Intracranial pressure will rise as a result of continued brain growth within the rigid skull . [ 14 ] It appears that in children with *$%^ , the expected decrease of intracranial blood is probably not occurring as it should according to the Monro-Kellie hypothesis . [ 19 ] This is shown when the brain expands in the fixed skull , which gives a faster rise in intracranial pressure than would be expected . [ 19 ] The short stops in breathing during the sleep are the mainstay of OSA . Other symptoms can be difficulty in breathing , snoring , day-time sleepiness and perspiration . [ 4 ] The main causative agent of OSA is the [ midface hypoplasia ] , which also poses a risk to the eyes that can be seen bulging out of the eye sockets . Other factors , such as a micrognathism and adenoid hypertrophy , are likely to contribute in causing OSA . [ 4 ] The most common syndromic forms of *$%^ ; i.e . Apert , Crouzon and Pfeiffer , have an increased risk of developing OSA . The children have nearly 50 % chance of developing this condition . [ 4 ] A theory regarding the involvement of OSA as a causative agent for elevated intracranial pressure suggests an association with the auto-regulation of blood flow in the brain . [ 20 ] Certain cells in the brain respond specifically to an increase of CO2 in the blood . [ 3 ] [ 21 ] The response involves vasodilatation of the cranial vault blood vessels , increasing the volume of one of the elements in the Monro-Kellie doctrine . [ 3 ] [ 21 ] The increase of CO2 concentration in the blood is a consequence of impaired breathing , especially seen when the child suffering from OSA is sleeping . [ 3 ] [ 21 ] It is well documented that the highest spikes in intracranial pressure often occur during sleep . [ 3 ] [ 21 ] Impaired venous outflow is often caused by a hypoplastic jugular foramen . [ 20 ] This causes an increase in the intracranial blood volume , thereby causing an increase in intracranial pressure . [ 20 ] This can be further complicated with a possible Arnold-Chiari malformation , which can partially obstruct the flow of cerebro-spinal fluid from the neurocranium to the spinal cord . [ 5 ] The Chiari malformation may be asymptomatic or present with ataxia , spasticity or abnormalities in breathing , swallowing or sleeping . [ 5 ] Due to the impaired venous outflow , which may be further complicated with an Arnold-Chiari malformation , there is often a clinical image of hydrocephalus present . Hydrocephalus is seen in 6.5 to 8 % of patients with Apert\u2019s syndrome , 25.6 % in patients with Crouzon\u2019s syndrome and 27.8 % of those with Pfeifer\u2019s syndrome . [ 22 ] Ventriculomegaly is a usual finding in children with the Apert syndrome . [ 23 ] Neurobehavioural impairment includes problems with attention and planning , processing speed , visual spatial skills , language , reading and spelling . [ 9 ] A decreased IQ may also be part of the problems . [ 9 ] It has been suggested that these problems are caused by a primary malformation of the brain , rather than being a consequence of the growth restriction of the skull and elevated intracranial pressure . Some evidence for this statement has been provided by studies using computed tomographic ( CT scans ) and magnetic resonance imaging ( MRI ) to identify differences between the structures of the brains of healthy children and those affected with *$%^ . [ 9 ] It has been found that corrective surgery of the cranial vault alters the morphology of the brain compared with the situation before surgical intervention . [ 9 ] However the structure was still abnormal in comparison to children without *$%^ . [ 9 ]", "Craniosynostosis"], ["The first symptoms of *$%^ are often vague making diagnosis difficult . Fatigue , loss of appetite , fever , and joint pain are common . Symptoms depend on primary tumor locations and metastases if present : [ 8 ] In the abdomen , a tumor may cause a swollen belly and constipation . A tumor in the chest may cause breathing problems . A tumor pressing on the spinal cord may cause weakness and thus an inability to stand , crawl , or walk . Bone lesions in the legs and hips may cause pain and limping . A tumor in the bones around the eyes or orbits may cause distinct bruising and swelling . Infiltration of the bone marrow may cause pallor from anemia . *$%^ often spreads to other parts of the body before any symptoms are apparent and 50 to 60 % of all *$%^ cases present with metastases . [ 9 ] The most common location for *$%^ to originate ( i.e. , the primary tumor ) is on the adrenal glands . This occurs in 40 % of localized tumors and in 60 % of cases of widespread disease . *$%^ can also develop anywhere along the sympathetic nervous system chain from the neck to the pelvis . Frequencies in different locations include : neck ( 1 % ) , chest ( 19 % ) , abdomen ( 30 % non-adrenal ) , or pelvis ( 1 % ) . In rare cases , no primary tumor can be discerned . [ 10 ] Rare but characteristic presentations include transverse myelopathy ( tumor spinal cord compression , 5 % of cases ) , treatment-resistant diarrhea ( tumor vasoactive intestinal peptide secretion , 4 % of cases ) , Horner 's syndrome ( cervical tumor , 2.4 % of cases ) , opsoclonus myoclonus syndrome [ 11 ] and ataxia ( suspected paraneoplastic cause , 1.3 % of cases ) , and hypertension ( catecholamine secretion or renal artery compression , 1.3 % of cases ) .

In addition , each feature of this *$%^ may vary from subtle to severe . [ 4 ] A characteristic feature of *$%^ *$%^ is a somewhat flattened facial appearance . This is caused by underdeveloped bones in the middle of the face , including the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose . A particular group of physical features , called the Pierre Robin sequence , is common in children with *$%^ *$%^ . Robin sequence includes a U-shaped or sometimes V-shaped cleft palate ( an opening in the roof of the mouth ) with a tongue that is too large for the space formed by the small lower jaw . Children with a cleft palate are also prone to ear infections and occasionally swallowing difficulties . Many people with *$%^ *$%^ are very nearsighted ( described as having high myopia ) because of the shape of the eye . People with eye involvement are prone to increased pressure within the eye ( ocular hypertension ) which could lead to glaucoma and tearing or detachment of the light-sensitive retina of the eye ( retinal detachment ) . Cataract may also present as an ocular complication associated with *$%^ 's *$%^ . The jelly-like substance within the eye ( the vitreous humour ) has a distinctive appearance in the types of *$%^ *$%^ associated with the COL2A1 and COL11A1 genes . As a result , regular appointments to a specialist ophthalmologist are advised . The type of *$%^ *$%^ associated with the COL11A2 gene does not affect the eye . [ 2 ] People with this *$%^ have problems that affect things other than the eyes and ears . [ 4 ] Arthritis , abnormality to ends of long bones , vertebrae abnormality , curvature of the spine , scoliosis , joint pain , and double jointedness are all problems that can occur in the bones and joints . Physical characteristics of people with *$%^ can include flat cheeks , flat nasal bridge , small upper jaw , pronounced upper lip groove , small lower jaw , and palate abnormalities , these tend to lessen with age and normal growth and palate abnormalities can be treated with routine surgery . Another sign of *$%^ *$%^ is mild to severe hearing loss that , for some people , may be progressive ( see hearing loss with craniofacial syndromes ) . The joints of affected children and young adults may be very flexible ( hypermobile ) . Arthritis often appears at an early age and worsens as a person gets older . Learning difficulties , not intelligence , can also occur because of hearing and sight impairments if the school is not informed and the student is not assisted within the learning environment .

[ 2 ] The cartilage under the kneecap is a natural shock absorber , and overuse , injury , and many other factors can cause increased deterioration and breakdown of the cartilage . The cartilage is no longer smooth and therefore movement and use is painful .

In the late infantile form , which is the most common form of MLD ( 50-60 % ) , affected children begin having difficulty walking after the first year of life , usually at 15\u201324 months . Symptoms include muscle wasting and weakness , muscle rigidity , developmental delays , progressive loss of vision leading to blindness , convulsions , impaired swallowing , paralysis , and dementia . Children may become comatose . Untreated , most children with this form of MLD die by age 5 , often much sooner . Children with the juvenile form of MLD ( onset between 3 and 10 years of age ) usually begin with impaired school performance , mental deterioration , and dementia and then develop symptoms similar to the late infantile form but with slower progression . Age of death is variable , but normally within 10 to 15 years of symptom onset although some juveniles can live for several decades or longer after onset . The adult form commonly begins after age 16 often with an onset in the 4th or 5th decade of life and presents as a psychiatric disorder or progressive dementia . Adult-onset MLD usually progresses more slowly than the late infantile and juvenile forms , with a protracted course of a decade or more .

Its main features are hypogammaglobulinemia and recurrent infections . Hypogammaglobulinemia manifests as a significant decrease in the levels of IgG antibodies , usually alongside IgA antibodies ; IgM antibody levels are also decreased in about 50 % of patients . [ 2 ] Infections are a direct result of the low antibody levels in the circulation of patients , which do not adequately protect them against pathogens . The microorganisms that most frequently cause infections in CVID are bacteria Haemophilus influenzae , Streptococcus pneumoniae and Staphylococcus aureus . Pathogens less often isolated from patients include Neisseria meningitidis , Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Giardia lamblia . Infections mostly affect the respiratory tract ( nose , sinuses , bronchi , lungs ) and the ears ; they can also occur at other sites , such as the eyes , skin and gastrointestinal tract . These infections respond to antibiotics but can recur upon their discontinuation . Bronchiectasis can develop when severe , recurrent pulmonary infections are left untreated . In addition to infections , CVID patients can develop complications of different kinds . These include : autoimmune manifestations , e.g . pernicious anemia , autoimmune haemolytic anemia ( AHA ) , idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura ( ITP ) , psoriasis , vitiligo , rheumatoid arthritis , primary hypothyroidism , atrophic gastritis . Autoimmunity is the main type of complication in CVID patients , appearing in some form in up to 50 % of individuals ; malignancies , particularly Non-Hodgkin 's lymphoma and gastric carcinoma ; enteropathy , which manifests with a blunting of intestinal villi and inflammation , and is usually accompanied by symptoms such as abdominal cramps , diarrhea , constipation and , in some cases , malabsorption and weight loss . Symptoms of CVID enteropathy are similar to those of celiac disease , but do n't respond to a gluten-free diet . Infectious causes must be excluded before a diagnosis of enteropathy can be made , as CVID patients are more susceptible to intestinal infections , e.g . by Giardia lamblia ; lymphocytic infiltration of tissues , which can cause enlargement of lymph nodes ( lymphadenopathy ) , of the spleen ( splenomegaly ) and of the liver ( hepatomegaly ) , as well as the formation of granulomas . Anxiety and depression can occur , as a result of dealing with the other symptoms . [ 3 ]", "Common variable immunodeficiency"], ["Though the etiology is not well understood , the disease is thought to be due to immune system dysfunction , and particularly improper functioning of neutrophils . In support of an immune etiology , a variety of immune mediators such as IL-8 , IL-1\u03b2 , IL-6 , interferon ( IFN ) -\u03b3 , G-CSF , TNF , matrix metallopaptidase ( MMP ) -9 , MMP-10 , and Elafin have all been reported to be elevated in patients with *$%^ *$%^ .

The disorder usually begins in the legs , but it may start in the tongue or the hands . Symptoms may include difficulty with balance , weakness and stiffness in the legs , and clumsiness . Other common symptoms are spasticity ( involuntary muscle contraction due to the stretching of muscle . Muscle contraction is dependent on the velocity of the stretch ) in the hands , feet , or legs , foot dragging , and speech and swallowing problems due to involvement of the facial muscles . Breathing may also become compromised in the later stages of the disease , causing those patients who develop ventilatory failure to require noninvasive ventilatory support . [ 2 ] Hyperreflexia is another key feature of PLS as seen in patients presenting with the Babinski 's sign .

[ 4 ] PLS is not considered hereditary when onset is in adulthood ; however , juvenile *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ ( JPLS ) has been linked to a mutation in the ALS2 gene which encodes the cell-signalling protein alsin . [ 5 ] The issue of whether PLS exists as a different entity from ALS is not clear , as some patients initially diagnosed as having PLS ultimately develop lower motor neuron signs . [ 6 ] [ 7 ] There are no specific tests for the diagnosis of PLS . Therefore , the diagnosis occurs as the result of eliminating other possible causes of the symptoms and by an extended observation period . [ 8 ]", "Primary lateral sclerosis"], ["There are three main stages of HIV infection : acute infection , clinical latency and AIDS . [ 18 ] [ 5 ] The initial period following the contraction of HIV is called acute HIV , primary HIV or acute retroviral syndrome . [ 18 ] [ 19 ] Many individuals develop an influenza-like illness or a mononucleosis-like illness 2\u20134 weeks post exposure while others have no significant symptoms . [ 20 ] [ 21 ] Symptoms occur in 40\u201390 % of cases and most commonly include fever , large tender lymph nodes , throat inflammation , a rash , headache , and/or sores of the mouth and genitals . [ 19 ] [ 21 ] The rash , which occurs in 20\u201350 % of cases , presents itself on the trunk and is maculopapular , classically . [ 22 ] Some people also develop opportunistic infections at this stage . [ 19 ] Gastrointestinal symptoms such as nausea , vomiting or diarrhea may occur , as may neurological symptoms of peripheral neuropathy or Guillain-Barre syndrome . [ 21 ] The duration of the symptoms varies , but is usually one or two weeks . [ 21 ] Due to their nonspecific character , these symptoms are not often recognized as signs of HIV infection . Even cases that do get seen by a family doctor or a hospital are often misdiagnosed as one of the many common infectious diseases with overlapping symptoms . Thus , it is recommended that HIV be considered in people presenting an unexplained fever who may have risk factors for the infection . [ 21 ] The initial symptoms are followed by a stage called clinical latency , asymptomatic HIV , or chronic HIV . [ 5 ] Without treatment , this second stage of the natural history of HIV infection can last from about three years [ 23 ] to over 20 years [ 24 ] ( on average , about eight years ) . [ 25 ] While typically there are few or no symptoms at first , near the end of this stage many people experience fever , weight loss , gastrointestinal problems and muscle pains . [ 5 ] Between 50 and 70 % of people also develop persistent generalized lymphadenopathy , characterized by unexplained , non-painful enlargement of more than one group of lymph nodes ( other than in the groin ) for over three to six months . [ 18 ] Although most HIV-1 infected individuals have a detectable viral load and in the absence of treatment will eventually progress to AIDS , a small proportion ( about 5 % ) retain high levels of CD4+ T cells ( T helper cells ) without antiretroviral therapy for more than 5 years . [ 21 ] [ 26 ] These individuals are classified as HIV controllers or long-term nonprogressors ( LTNP ) . [ 26 ] Another group consists of those who maintain a low or undetectable viral load without anti-retroviral treatment , known as `` elite controllers '' or `` elite suppressors '' . They represent approximately 1 in 300 infected persons . [ 27 ] Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome ( AIDS ) is defined in terms of either a CD4+ T cell count below 200 cells per \u00b5L or the occurrence of specific diseases in association with an HIV infection . [ 21 ] In the absence of specific treatment , around half of people infected with HIV develop AIDS within ten years . [ 21 ] The most common initial conditions that alert to the presence of AIDS are pneumocystis pneumonia ( 40 % ) , cachexia in the form of HIV wasting syndrome ( 20 % ) , and esophageal candidiasis . [ 21 ] Other common signs include recurring respiratory tract infections . [ 21 ] Opportunistic infections may be caused by bacteria , viruses , fungi , and parasites that are normally controlled by the immune system . [ 28 ] Which infections occur depends partly on what organisms are common in the person 's environment . [ 21 ] These infections may affect nearly every organ system . [ 29 ] People with AIDS have an increased risk of developing various viral-induced cancers , including Kaposi 's sarcoma , Burkitt 's lymphoma , primary central nervous system lymphoma , and cervical cancer . [ 22 ] Kaposi 's sarcoma is the most common cancer occurring in 10 to 20 % of people with HIV . [ 30 ] The second most common cancer is lymphoma , which is the cause of death of nearly 16 % of people with AIDS and is the initial sign of AIDS in 3 to 4 % . [ 30 ] Both these cancers are associated with human herpesvirus 8 . [ 30 ] Cervical cancer occurs more frequently in those with AIDS because of its association with human papillomavirus ( HPV ) . [ 30 ] Conjunctival cancer ( of the layer that lines the inner part of eyelids and the white part of the eye ) is also more common in those with HIV . [ 31 ] Additionally , people with AIDS frequently have systemic symptoms such as prolonged fevers , sweats ( particularly at night ) , swollen lymph nodes , chills , weakness , and unintended weight loss . [ 32 ] Diarrhea is another common symptom , present in about 90 % of people with AIDS . [ 33 ] They can also be affected by diverse psychiatric and neurological symptoms independent of opportunistic infections and cancers .

Whenever possible , a doctor sends a sample of infected material to a laboratory to confirm identification of the fungus .", "Aspergillosis"], ["*$%^ *$%^ *$%^ affects movement , producing motor symptoms . [ 4 ] Non-motor symptoms , which include autonomic dysfunction , neuropsychiatric problems ( mood , cognition , behavior or thought alterations ) , and sensory and sleep difficulties , are also common . Some of these non-motor symptoms are often present at the time of diagnosis and can precede motor symptoms . [ 4 ] Four motor symptoms are considered cardinal in PD : tremor , rigidity , slowness of movement , and postural instability . [ 4 ] Tremor is the most apparent and well-known symptom . [ 4 ] It is the most common ; though around 30 % of individuals with PD do not have tremor at *$%^ onset , most develop it as the *$%^ progresses . [ 4 ] It is usually a rest tremor : maximal when the limb is at rest and disappearing with voluntary movement and sleep . [ 4 ] It affects to a greater extent the most distal part of the limb and at onset typically appears in only a single arm or leg , becoming bilateral later . [ 4 ] Frequency of PD tremor is between 4 and 6 hertz ( cycles per second ) . A feature of tremor is pill-rolling , the tendency of the index finger of the hand to get into contact with the thumb and perform together a circular movement . [ 4 ] [ 14 ] The term derives from the similarity between the movement in people with PD and the earlier pharmaceutical technique of manually making pills . [ 14 ] Hypokinesia ( slowness of movement ) is another characteristic feature of PD , and is associated with difficulties along the whole course of the movement process , from planning to initiation and finally execution of a movement . [ 4 ] Performance of sequential and simultaneous movement is hindered . [ 4 ] Bradykinesia is commonly a very disabling symptom in the early stages of the *$%^ . [ 5 ] Initial manifestations are problems when performing daily tasks which require fine motor control such as writing , sewing or getting dressed . [ 4 ] Clinical evaluation is based in similar tasks such as alternating movements between both hands or both feet . [ 5 ] Bradykinesia is not equal for all movements or times . It is modified by the activity or emotional state of the subject , to the point that some people are barely able to walk yet can still ride a bicycle . [ 4 ] Generally people with PD have less difficulty when some sort of external cue is provided . [ 4 ] [ 15 ] Rigidity is stiffness and resistance to limb movement caused by increased muscle tone , an excessive and continuous contraction of muscles . [ 4 ] In parkinsonism the rigidity can be uniform ( lead-pipe rigidity ) or ratchety ( cogwheel rigidity ) . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] [ 16 ] [ 17 ] The combination of tremor and increased tone is considered to be at the origin of cogwheel rigidity . [ 18 ] Rigidity may be associated with joint pain ; such pain being a frequent initial manifestation of the *$%^ . [ 4 ] In early stages of *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ , rigidity is often asymmetrical and it tends to affect the neck and shoulder muscles prior to the muscles of the face and extremities . [ 19 ] With the progression of the *$%^ , rigidity typically affects the whole body and reduces the ability to move . Postural instability is typical in the late stages of the *$%^ , leading to impaired balance and frequent falls , [ 20 ] and secondarily to bone fractures . [ 4 ] Instability is often absent in the initial stages , especially in younger people . [ 5 ] Up to 40 % may experience falls and around 10 % may have falls weekly , with number of falls being related to the severity of PD . [ 4 ] Other recognized motor signs and symptoms include gait and posture disturbances such as festination ( rapid shuffling steps and a forward-flexed posture when walking ) , [ 4 ] speech and swallowing disturbances including voice disorders , [ 21 ] mask-like face expression or small handwriting , although the range of possible motor problems that can appear is large . [ 4 ] *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ can cause neuropsychiatric disturbances which can range from mild to severe . This includes disorders of speech , cognition , mood , behaviour , and thought . [ 4 ] Cognitive disturbances can occur in the initial stages of the *$%^ and sometimes prior to diagnosis , and increase in prevalence with duration of the *$%^ . [ 4 ] [ 22 ] The most common cognitive deficit in affected individuals is executive dysfunction , which can include problems with planning , cognitive flexibility , abstract thinking , rule acquisition , initiating appropriate actions and inhibiting inappropriate actions , and selecting relevant sensory information . Fluctuations in attention and slowed cognitive speed are among other cognitive difficulties . Memory is affected , specifically in recalling learned information . Nevertheless , improvement appears when recall is aided by cues . Visuospatial difficulties are also part of the *$%^ , seen for example when the individual is asked to perform tests of facial recognition and perception of the orientation of drawn lines . [ 22 ] A person with PD has two to six times the risk of dementia compared to the general population . [ 4 ] [ 22 ] The prevalence of dementia increases with duration of the *$%^ . [ 22 ] Dementia is associated with a reduced quality of life in people with PD and their caregivers , increased mortality , and a higher probability of needing nursing home care . [ 22 ] Behavior and mood alterations are more common in PD without cognitive impairment than in the general population , and are usually present in PD with dementia . The most frequent mood difficulties are depression , apathy and anxiety . [ 4 ] Establishing the diagnosis of depression is complicated by symptoms that often occur in *$%^ *$%^ including dementia , decreased facial expression , decreased movement , a state of indifference , and quiet speech . [ 23 ] Impulse control behaviors such as medication overuse and craving , binge eating , hypersexuality , or pathological gambling can appear in PD and have been related to the medications used to manage the *$%^ . [ 4 ] [ 24 ] Psychotic symptoms\u2014hallucinations or delusions\u2014occur in 4 % of people with PD , and it is assumed that the main precipitant of psychotic phenomena in Parkinson\u2019s *$%^ is dopaminergic excess secondary to treatment ; it therefore becomes more common with increasing age and levodopa intake . [ 25 ] [ 26 ] In addition to cognitive and motor symptoms , PD can impair other body functions . Sleep problems are a feature of the *$%^ and can be worsened by medications . [ 4 ] Symptoms can manifest as daytime drowsiness , disturbances in REM sleep , or insomnia . [ 4 ] A systematic review shows that sleep attacks occur in 13.0 % of patients with *$%^ *$%^ *$%^ on dopaminergic medications . [ 27 ] Alterations in the autonomic nervous system can lead to orthostatic hypotension ( low blood pressure upon standing ) , oily skin and excessive sweating , urinary incontinence and altered sexual function . [ 4 ] Constipation and gastric dysmotility can be severe enough to cause discomfort and even endanger health . [ 28 ] PD is related to several eye and vision abnormalities such as decreased blink rate , dry eyes , deficient ocular pursuit ( eye tracking ) and saccadic movements ( fast automatic movements of both eyes in the same direction ) , difficulties in directing gaze upward , and blurred or double vision . [ 4 ] [ 29 ] Changes in perception may include an impaired sense of smell , sensation of pain and paresthesia ( skin tingling and numbness ) .

[ 5 ] [ 6 ] In some individuals , the regurgitation is small , occurring over a long period of time following ingestion , and can be rechewed and swallowed . In others , the amount can be bilious and short lasting , and must be expelled . While some only experience symptoms following some meals , most experience episodes following any ingestion , from a single bite to a massive feast . [ 7 ] However , some long-term patients will find a select couple of food or drink items that do not trigger a response . Unlike typical vomiting , the regurgitation is typically described as effortless and unforced . [ 5 ] There is seldom nausea preceding the expulsion , and the undigested food lacks the bitter taste and odour of stomach acid and bile . [ 5 ] Symptoms can begin to manifest at any point from the ingestion of the meal to 120 minutes thereafter . [ 6 ] However , the more common range is between 30 seconds to 1 hour after the completion of a meal . [ 7 ] Symptoms tend to cease when the ruminated contents become acidic .

Although every type of *$%^ has different symptoms , there are certain signs that are common for all of them , including redness of the skin , swelling , itching and skin lesions with sometimes oozing and scarring . Also , the area of the skin on which the symptoms appear tends to be different with every type of *$%^ , whether on the neck , wrist , forearm , thigh or ankle . Although the location may vary , the primary symptom of this condition is itchy skin . More rarely , it may appear on the genital area , such as the vulva or scrotum . [ 17 ] Symptoms of this type of *$%^ may be very intense and may come and go . Irritant contact *$%^ is usually more painful than itchy . Although the symptoms of atopic *$%^ vary from person to person , the most common symptoms are dry , itchy , red skin . Typical affected skin areas include the folds of the arms , the back of the knees , wrists , face and hands . *$%^ herpetiformis symptoms include itching , stinging and a burning sensation . Papules and vesicles are commonly present . The small red bumps experienced in this type of *$%^ are usually about 1 cm in size , red in color and may be found symmetrically grouped or distributed on the upper or lower back , buttocks , elbows , knees , neck , shoulders , and scalp . [ 18 ] Less frequently , the rash may appear inside the mouth or near the hairline . The symptoms of seborrheic *$%^ on the other hand , tend to appear gradually , from dry or greasy scaling of the scalp ( dandruff ) to hair loss . In severe cases , pimples may appear along the hairline , behind the ears , on the eyebrows , on the bridge of the nose , around the nose , on the chest , and on the upper back . [ 19 ] In newborns , the condition causes a thick and yellowish scalp rash , often accompanied by a diaper rash . Perioral *$%^ refers to a red bumpy rash around the mouth . [ 20 ]", "Dermatitis"], ["Characteristic symptoms vary with severity . In general symptoms are internal or external bleeding episodes , which are called `` bleeds '' . [ 4 ] [ 5 ] People with more severe *$%^ suffer more severe and more frequent bleeds , while people with mild *$%^ usually suffer more minor symptoms except after surgery or serious trauma . Moderate haemophiliacs have variable symptoms which manifest along a spectrum between severe and mild forms . In both *$%^ A and B , there is spontaneous bleeding but a normal bleeding time , normal prothrombin time , normal thrombin time , but prolonged partial thromboplastin time . Internal bleeding is common in people with severe *$%^ and some individuals with moderate *$%^ . The most characteristic type of internal bleed is a joint bleed where blood enters into the joint spaces . [ 6 ] This is most common with severe haemophiliacs and can occur spontaneously ( without evident trauma ) . If not treated promptly , joint bleeds can lead to permanent joint damage and disfigurement . [ 6 ] Bleeding into soft tissues such as muscles and subcutaneous tissues is less severe but can lead to damage and requires treatment . Children with mild to moderate *$%^ may not have any signs or symptoms at birth especially if they do not undergo circumcision . Their first symptoms are often frequent and large bruises and haematomas from frequent bumps and falls as they learn to walk . Swelling and bruising from bleeding in the joints , soft tissue , and muscles may also occur . Children with mild *$%^ may not have noticeable symptoms for many years . Often , the first sign in very mild haemophiliacs is heavy bleeding from a dental procedure , an accident , or surgery . Females who are carriers usually have enough clotting factors from their one normal gene to prevent serious bleeding problems , though some may present as mild haemophiliacs . Severe complications are much more common in severe and moderate haemophiliacs . Complications may be both directly from the disease or from its treatment : [ 7 ] Deep internal bleeding , e.g . deep-muscle bleeding , leading to swelling , numbness or pain of a limb . Joint damage from haemarthrosis ( haemophilic arthropathy ) , potentially with severe pain , disfigurement , and even destruction of the joint and development of debilitating arthritis . Transfusion transmitted infection from blood transfusions that are given as treatment . Adverse reactions to clotting factor treatment , including the development of an immune inhibitor which renders factor replacement less effective . Intracranial haemorrhage is a serious medical emergency caused by the buildup of pressure inside the skull . It can cause disorientation , nausea , loss of consciousness , brain damage , and death . Haemophilic arthropathy is characterized by chronic proliferative synovitis and cartilage destruction . [ 8 ] If an intra-articular bleed is not drained early , it may cause apoptosis of chondrocytes and affect the synthesis of proteoglycans . The hypertrophied and fragile synovial lining while attempting to eliminate excessive blood may be more likely to easily rebleed , leading to a vicious cycle of hemarthrosis-synovitis-hemarthrosis . In addition , iron deposition in the synovium may induce an inflammatory response activating the immune system and stimulating angiogenesis , resulting in cartilage and bone destruction . [ 9 ] Like most aspects of the disorder , life expectancy varies with severity and adequate treatment . People with severe *$%^ who do n't receive adequate , modern treatment have greatly shortened lifespans and often do not reach maturity . Prior to the 1960s when effective treatment became available , average life expectancy was only 11 years . [ 6 ] By the 1980s the life span of the average haemophiliac receiving appropriate treatment was 50\u201360 years . [ 6 ] Today with appropriate treatment , males with *$%^ typically have a near normal quality of life with an average lifespan approximately 10 years shorter than an unaffected male . [ 10 ] Since the 1980s the primary leading cause of death of people with severe *$%^ has shifted from haemorrhage to HIV/AIDS acquired through treatment with contaminated blood products . [ 6 ] The second leading cause of death related to severe *$%^ complications is intracranial haemorrhage which today accounts for one third of all deaths of people with *$%^ . Two other major causes of death include hepatitis infections causing cirrhosis and obstruction of air or blood flow due to soft tissue haemorrhage . [ 6 ]", "Haemophilia"], ["*$%^ defines a group of autoimmune interepithelial blistering diseases that are characterized by loss of normal cell-cell adhesion ( acantholysis ) , and by the presence of pathogenic ( predominantly IgG ) autoantibodies reacting against epithelial adhesion molecules . [ 12 ] *$%^ is further divided in two major subtypes : *$%^ vulgaris ( PV ) and *$%^ foliaceus ( PF ) . However , several other disorders such as IgA *$%^ , IgE *$%^ , *$%^ herpetiformis , drug induced *$%^ , Senear Usher syndrome and endemic *$%^ foliaceus exist ; recognized by a dermatologist from the appearance and distribution of the skin lesions . It is also commonly diagnosed by specialists practicing otolaryngology- head and neck surgery , periodontists , oral and maxillofacial surgeons and eye doctors , as lesions can affect the eyes and mucous membrane of the oral cavity . Intraorally it resembles the more common diseases lichen planus and mucous membrane pemphigoid . [ 13 ] Definitive diagnosis requires examination of a skin or mucous membrane biopsy by a dermatopathologist or oral pathologist . The skin biopsy is taken from the edge of a blister , prepared for histopathology and examined with a microscope . The pathologist looks for an intraepidermal vesicle caused by the breaking apart of epidermal cells ( acantholysis ) . Thus , the superficial ( upper ) portion of the epidermis sloughs off , leaving the bottom layer of cells on the `` floor '' of the blister . This bottom layer of cells is said to have a `` tombstone appearance '' . Definitive diagnosis also requires the demonstration of anti-desmoglein autoantibodies by direct immunofluorescence on the skin biopsy . These antibodies appear as IgG deposits along the desmosomes between epidermal cells , a pattern reminiscent of chicken wire . Anti-desmoglein antibodies can also be detected in a blood sample using the ELISA technique . Half of people with *$%^ have mouth lesions alone during the first year but develop skin lesions later . *$%^ is a group of autoimmune blistering diseases that may be classified into the following types : [ 14 ] *$%^ vulgaris , of which there several forms : *$%^ vegetans *$%^ vegetans of Hallopeau *$%^ vegetans of Neumann *$%^ foliaceus , of which there several forms : *$%^ erythematosus or Senear-Usher Syndrome Endemic *$%^ foliaceus with its three variants , Fogo Selvagem , the new variant endemic *$%^ Foliaeus and Tunisian endemic *$%^ foliaceus Paraneoplastic *$%^ IgA *$%^ , of which there several forms : Subcorneal pustular dermatosis Intraepidermal neutrophilic IgA dermatosis Drug induced *$%^", "Pemphigus"], ["There are disturbances in sensory nerves and motor nerves and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system at the level of the lesion or below . Therefore , the signs and symptoms depend on the area of spine involved : [ 3 ] Cervical : If the upper cervical cord is involved , all four limbs may be involved and there is risk of respiratory paralysis ( cervical nerve segments C3 , 4 , 5 innervate the abdominal diaphragm ) . Lesions of the lower cervical ( C5\u2013T1 ) region will cause a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the upper limbs , and exclusively upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs . Cervical lesions account for about 20 % of cases . [ 3 ] Thoracic : A lesion of the thoracic spinal cord ( T1\u201312 ) will produce upper motor neuron signs in the lower limbs , presenting as a spastic diplegia . This is the most common location of the lesion , and therefore most individuals will have weakness of the lower limbs . [ 4 ] Lumbar : A lesion of the lower part of the spinal cord ( L1\u2013S5 ) often produces a combination of upper and lower motor neuron signs in the lower limbs . Lumbar lesions account for about 10 % of cases . [ 3 ] Symptoms include weakness and numbness of the limbs , deficits in sensation and motor skills , dysfunctional sphincter activities , and dysfunction of the autonomic nervous system . Symptoms typically develop over the course of hours or days and may progress after weeks . [ 2 ] Sensory symptoms of *$%^ *$%^ may include a sensation of pins and needles traveling up from the feet . [ 2 ] Back pain can occur at the level of the inflamed segment of the spinal cord . [ 2 ] The degree and type of sensory loss will depend upon the extent of the involvement of the various sensory tracts , but there is often a `` sensory level '' ( at the sensory segmental level of the spinal cord below which sensation to pain or light touch is impaired ) . Motor weakness occurs due to involvement of the pyramidal tracts and mainly affects the muscles that flex the legs and extend the arms . [ 2 ] Involvement of the autonomic nervous system is common and frequently leads to impaired function of the bladder and bowel and can also lead to episodes of high blood pressure . [ 2 ]", "Transverse myelitis"], ["There are three generalized categories in which *$%^ could be acquired by a person . The three categories are head trauma ( example : head injuries ) , traumatic events ( example : seeing something devastating to the mind ) , or physical deficiencies ( example : atrophy of the hippocampus ) . The majority of *$%^ and related memory issues derive from the first two categories as these are more common and the third could be considered a sub category of the first . Head trauma is a very broad range as it deals with any kind of injury or active action toward the brain which might cause *$%^ . Retrograde and Anterograde *$%^ are more often seen from events like this , an exact example of a cause of the two would be electroshock therapy , which would cause both briefly for the receiving patient . Traumatic events are more subjective . What is traumatic is dependent on what the person finds to be traumatic . Regardless , a traumatic event is an event where something so distressing occurs that the mind chooses to forget rather than deal with the stress . A common example of *$%^ that is caused by traumatic events is dissociative *$%^ , which occurs when the person forgets an event that has deeply disturbed them . [ 8 ] An example would be a person forgetting a fatal and graphic car accident involving their loved ones . Physical deficiencies are different from head trauma as physical lean more toward passive physical issues . The difference would be having surgery that removes part of the brain , this would be active and thus head trauma , while the surgery caused the surrounding areas to atrophy , which is passive . Henry Molaison is a great example of physical deficiencies as parts of his brain began to atrophy after his surgery . [ 1 ] Amongst specific causes of *$%^ are the following : Electroconvulsive therapy in which seizures are electrically induced in patients for therapeutic effect can have acute effects including both retrograde and anterograde *$%^ .

[ 1 ] BDD is often associated with social anxiety *$%^ . [ 8 ] In BDD , the perceived bodily defect can be at virtually any area , yet is usually the nose , skin , or hair . [ 2 ] Attempts at self-treatment can paradoxically create lesions where none previously existed . [ 2 ] BDD often drives a quest to obtain dermatological treatment or cosmetic surgery , which interventions typically do not resolve the distress . [ 2 ] Sometimes deluded in believing that persons are covertly pointing out their flaws . Most generally , one experiencing BDD ruminates over the perceived bodily defect up to several hours daily , uses either social avoidance or camouflaging with cosmestics or apparel , repetitively checks the appearance , compares it to that of other persons , and might often seek verbal reassurances . [ 2 ] [ 1 ] BDD 's severity can wax and wane , and flareups tend to yield absences from school , work , or socializing , sometimes leading to protracted social isolation , with some becoming housebound for extended periods .

Acute dilatation of the ventricular system is more likely to manifest with the nonspecific signs and symptoms of increased intracranial pressure . By contrast chronic dilatation ( especially in the elderly population ) may have a more insidious onset presenting , for instance , with Hakim 's triad ( Adams triad ) . Symptoms of increased intracranial pressure may include headaches , vomiting , nausea , papilledema , sleepiness or coma . Elevated intracranial pressure may result in uncal and/or cerebellar tonsill herniation , with resulting life-threatening brain stem compression .

Focal neurological deficits may also occur , such as abducens nerve palsy and vertical gaze palsy ( Parinaud syndrome due to compression of the quadrigeminal plate , where the neural centers coordinating the conjugated vertical eye movement are located ) .

Alcoholism , for example , has been identified as a cause of dilated *$%^ , as has drug toxicity , and certain infections ( including Hepatitis C ) .

[ 2 ] Although usually found near the coccyx , the condition can also affect the navel , armpit or genital region , [ 3 ] though these locations are much rarer . Symptoms include : [ 4 ] Pain/discomfort or swelling above the anus or near the tailbone that comes and goes Opaque yellow ( purulent ) or bloody discharge from the tailbone area Unexpected moisture in the tailbone region Discomfort with sitting on the tailbone , doing sit-ups or riding a bike ( any activities that roll over the tailbone area ) Some people with a *$%^ *$%^ will be asymptomatic . [ 5 ] A sinus tract , or small channel , may originate from the source of infection and open to the surface of the skin . Material from the *$%^ may drain through the *$%^ sinus . A *$%^ *$%^ is usually painful , but with draining , the patient might not feel pain .", "Pilonidal cyst"], ["In *$%^ *$%^ , fragments of cartilage or bone become loose within a joint , leading to pain and inflammation . These fragments are sometimes referred to as joint mice . [ 7 ] OCD is a type of osteochondrosis in which a lesion has formed within the cartilage layer itself , giving rise to secondary inflammation . OCD most commonly affects the knee , although it can affect other joints such as the ankle or the elbow . [ 8 ] People with OCD report activity-related pain that develops gradually . Individual complaints usually consist of mechanical symptoms including pain , swelling , catching , locking , popping noises , and buckling / giving way ; the primary presenting symptom may be a restriction in the range of movement . [ 9 ] Symptoms typically present within the initial weeks of stage I ; however , the onset of stage II occurs within months and offers little time for diagnosis . The disease progresses rapidly beyond stage II , as OCD lesions quickly move from stable cysts or fissures to unstable fragments . Non-specific symptoms , caused by similar injuries such as sprains and strains , can delay a definitive diagnosis . [ 10 ] Physical examination typically reveals fluid in the joint , tenderness , and crepitus . The tenderness may initially spread , but often reverts to a well-defined focal point as the lesion progresses . Just as OCD shares symptoms with common maladies , acute osteochondral fracture has a similar presentation with tenderness in the affected joint , but is usually associated with a fatty hemarthrosis . Although there is no significant pathologic gait or characteristic alignment abnormality associated with OCD , the patient may walk with the involved leg externally rotated in an attempt to avoid tibial spine impingement on the lateral aspect of the medial condyle of the femur . [ 11 ]", "Osteochondritis dissecans"], ["*$%^ *$%^ can range from barely detectable to severely malformed or dislocated . The congenital form , teratologic or non-reducible dislocation occurs as part of more complex conditions . The condition can be bilateral or unilateral : If both *$%^ joints are affected one speaks of `` bilateral '' *$%^ . In this case some diagnostic indicators like asymmetric folds and leg-length inequality do not apply . In unilateral *$%^ only one joint shows deformity , the contralateral side may show resulting effects . [ 3 ] In the majority of unilateral cases the left *$%^ has the *$%^ . If the joint is fully dislocated a false acetabulum often forms ( often higher up on the pelvis ) opposite the dislocated femoral head position . In actetabular *$%^ the acetabulum ( socket ) is too shallow or deformed . The center-edge angle is measured as described by Wiberg . [ 4 ] Two forms of femoral *$%^ are coxa vara , in which the femur head grows at too narrow an angle to the shaft , and coxa valga , in which the angle is too wide . A rare type , the `` Beukes familial *$%^ *$%^ '' is found among Afrikaners that are members of the Beukes family . The femur head is flat and irregular . Sufferers develop osteoarthritis at an early age .

The two most common locations are cranially at the clivus and in the sacrum at the bottom of the spine . [ 1 ]", "Chordoma"], ["*$%^ is commonly caused by constipation , by reflexive withholding of stool , by various physiological , psychological , or neurological disorders , or from surgery ( a somewhat rare occurrence ) . The colon normally removes excess water from feces . If the feces or stool remains in the colon too long due to conditioned withholding or incidental constipation , so much water is removed that the stool becomes hard , and becomes painful for the child to expel in an ordinary bowel movement . A vicious cycle can develop , where the child may avoid moving his/her bowels in order to avoid the `` expected '' painful toilet episode . This cycle can result in so deeply conditioning the holding response that the rectal anal inhibitory response ( RAIR ) or anismus results . The RAIR has been shown to occur even under anesthesia and when voluntary control is lost . The hardened stool continues to build up and stretches the colon or rectum to the point where the normal sensations associated with impending bowel movements do not occur . Eventually , softer stool leaks around the blockage and can not be withheld by the anus , resulting in soiling . The child typically has no control over these leakage accidents , and may not be able to feel that they have occurred or are about to occur due to the loss of sensation in the rectum and the RAIR . Strong emotional reactions typically result from failed and repeated attempts to control this highly aversive bodily product . These reactions then in turn may complicate conventional treatments using stool softeners , sitting demands , and behavioral strategies . The onset of *$%^ is most often benign . The usual onset is associated with toilet training , demands that the child sit for long periods of time , and intense negative parental reactions to feces . Beginning school or preschool is another major environmental trigger with shared bathrooms . Feuding parents , siblings , moving , and divorce can also inhibit toileting behaviors and promote constipation . An initiating cause may become less relevant as chronic stimuli predominate .", "Encopresis"], ["The condition may be due to : Turner syndrome , and its variations ( i.e . mosaicism ) XX *$%^ *$%^ , also pure *$%^ *$%^ , 46 , XX Swyer syndrome , also pure *$%^ *$%^ , 46 , XY Perrault syndrome , XX *$%^ *$%^ + sensorineural hearing loss Mixed *$%^ *$%^ Exposure to environmental endocrine disruptors", "Premature ovarian failure"], ["XLA diagnosis usually begins due to a history of recurrent infections , mostly in the respiratory tract , through childhood . The diagnosis is probable when blood tests show the complete lack of circulating B cells ( determined by the B cell marker CD19 and/or CD20 ) , as well as low levels of all antibody classes , including IgG , IgA , IgM , IgE and IgD . [ 3 ] When XLA is suspected , it is possible to do a Western Blot test to determine whether the Btk protein is being expressed . Results of a genetic blood test confirm the diagnosis and will identify the specific Btk mutation , [ 3 ] however its cost prohibits its use in routine screening for all pregnancies . Women with an XLA patient in their family should seek genetic counseling before pregnancy . Although the symptoms of a XLA and other primary immune diseases ( PID ) include repeated and often severe infections , the average time for a diagnosis of a PID can be up to 10 years .", "X-linked agammaglobulinemia"], ["The best-known symptom of *$%^ *$%^ is one or more infected , enlarged , and painful lymph nodes , known as buboes . After being transmitted via the bite of an infected flea , the Y. pestis bacteria become localized in an inflamed lymph node where they begin to colonize and reproduce . Buboes associated with the *$%^ *$%^ are commonly found in the armpits , upper femoral , groin and neck region . Acral gangrene ( i.e. , of the fingers , toes , lips and nose ) is another common symptom . Because of its bite-based mode of transmission , the *$%^ *$%^ is often the first of a progressive series of illnesses . *$%^ *$%^ symptoms appear suddenly a few days after exposure to the bacterium . Symptoms include : Chills General ill feeling ( malaise ) High fever ( 39 \u00b0C ; 102 \u00b0F ) Muscle cramps [ 9 ] Seizures Smooth , painful lymph gland swelling called a bubo , commonly found in the groin , but may occur in the armpits or neck , most often near the site of the initial infection ( bite or scratch ) Pain may occur in the area before the swelling appears Gangrene of the extremities such as toes , fingers , lips and tip of the nose . [ 10 ] Other symptoms include heavy breathing , continuous vomiting of blood ( hematemesis ) , aching limbs , coughing , and extreme pain caused by the decay or decomposition of the skin while the person is still alive . Additional symptoms include extreme fatigue , gastrointestinal problems , lenticulae ( black dots scattered throughout the body ) , delirium , and coma .", "Bubonic plague"], ["A person having an attack of TGA has almost no capacity to establish new memories , but generally appears otherwise mentally alert and lucid , possessing full knowledge of self-identity and identity of close family , and maintaining intact perceptual skills and a wide repertoire of complex learned behavior . The individual simply can not recall anything that happened outside the last few minutes , while memory for more temporally distant events may or may not be largely intact . [ 1 ] [ 2 ] The degree of *$%^ is profound , and , in the interval during which the individual is aware of his or her condition , is often accompanied by anxiety . [ 3 ] The diagnostic criteria for TGA , as defined for purposes of clinical research , include : [ 2 ] The attack was witnessed by a capable observer and reported as being a definite loss of recent memory ( anterograde *$%^ ) . There was an absence of clouding of consciousness or other cognitive impairment other than *$%^ . There were no focal neurological signs or deficits during or after the attack . There were no features of epilepsy , or active epilepsy in the past two years , and the patient did not have any recent head injury . The attack resolved within 24 hours . This onset of TGA is generally fairly rapid , and its duration varies but generally lasts between 2 to 8 hours . [ 2 ] A person experiencing TGA typically has memory only of the past few minutes or less , and can not retain new information beyond that period of time . One of its bizarre features is perseveration , in which the victim of an attack faithfully and methodically repeats statements or questions , complete with profoundly identical intonation and gestures `` as if a fragment of a sound track is being repeatedly rerun . `` [ 4 ] This is found in almost all TGA attacks and is sometimes considered a defining characteristic of the condition . [ 2 ] [ 5 ] [ 6 ] The individual experiencing TGA retains social skills and older significant memories , almost always including knowing his or her own identity and the identity of family members , and the ability to perform various complex learned tasks including driving and other learned behavior ; one individual `` was able to continue putting together the alternator of his car . `` [ 2 ] Though outwardly appearing to be normal , a person with TGA is disoriented in time and space , perhaps knowing neither the year nor where they reside . Although confusion is sometimes reported , others consider this an imprecise observation , [ 6 ] but an elevated emotional state ( compared to patients experiencing *$%^ Ischemic Attack , or TIA ) is common . [ 7 ] In a large survey , 11 % of individuals in a TGA state were described as exhibiting `` emotionalism '' and 14 % `` fear of dying '' . [ 8 ] The attack lessens over a period of hours , with older memories returning first , and the repetitive fugue slowly lengthening so that the victim retains short-term memory for longer periods . While seemingly back to normal within 24 hours , there are subtle effects on memory that can persist longer . [ 9 ] [ 10 ] In the majority of cases there are no long-term effects other than a complete lack of recall for this period of the attack and an hour or two before its onset . [ 2 ] [ 11 ] There is emerging evidence for observable impairments in a minority of cases weeks or even years following a TGA attack . [ 9 ] [ 12 ] [ 13 ] There is also evidence that the victim is aware that something is not quite right , even though they ca n't pinpoint it . Persons suffering from the attack may vocalize signs that 'they just lost their memory ' , or that they believed they had a stroke , although they are n't aware of the other signs that they are displaying . The main sign of this condition is the repetitive actions of something that is not usually repeated .

Hormonal causes most frequently associated with *$%^ are hyperprolactinemia and thyroid conditions with elevated levels of thyroid-stimulating hormone ( TSH ) or thyrotropin-releasing hormone ( TRH ) . No obvious cause is found in about 50 % of cases . [ 1 ] Lactation requires the presence of prolactin , and the evaluation of *$%^ includes eliciting a history for various medications or foods ( methyldopa , opioids , antipsychotics , serotonin reuptake inhibitors , as well as licorice [ 4 ] ) and for behavioral causes ( stress , and breast and chest wall stimulation ) , as well as evaluation for pregnancy , pituitary adenomas ( with overproduction of prolactin or compression of the pituitary stalk ) , and hypothyroidism . Adenomas of the anterior pituitary are most often prolactinomas . Overproduction of prolactin leads to cessation of menstrual periods and infertility , which may be a diagnostic clue . *$%^ may also be caused by hormonal imbalances owing to birth control pills . *$%^ is also a side effect associated with the use of the second-generation H2 receptor antagonist cimetidine ( Tagamet ) . *$%^ can also be caused by antipsychotics that cause hyperprolactinemia by blocking dopamine receptors responsible for control of prolactin release . Of these , risperidone is the most notorious for causing this complication . [ citation needed ] Case reports suggest proton-pump inhibitors have been shown to cause *$%^ .", "Galactorrhea"], ["*$%^ allergies are not altogether different from other food allergies or respiratory allergies . However two conditions , exercise/aspirin induced anaphylaxis and urticaria occur more frequently with *$%^ allergies . Common symptoms of a *$%^ *$%^ include sacroiliitis , eczema ( atopic dermatitis ) , hives ( urticaria ) , asthma , `` Hay fever '' ( allergic rhinitis ) , angioedema ( tissue swelling due to fluid leakage from blood vessels ) , abdominal cramps , nausea , and vomiting . [ 15 ] Rarer symptoms include [ citation needed ] anaphylactic shock , anxiety , arthritis , bloated stomach , chest pains , depression or mood swings , diarrhea , dizziness , headache , joint and muscle aches and pains ( may be associated with progressive arthritis ) , palpitations , psoriasis , irritable bowel syndrome ( IBS ) , swollen throat or tongue , tiredness and lethargy , and unexplained cough . Reactions may become more severe with repeated exposure . *$%^ gliadins and potentially oat avenins are associated with another disease , known as wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis ( WDEIA ) which is similar to baker 's *$%^ as both are mediated by IgE responses . [ 16 ] In WDEIA , however , the \u03c9-gliadins [ 17 ] or a high molecular weight glutenin subunit , and similar proteins in other Triticeae genera enter the blood stream during exercise where they cause acute asthmatic or allergic reaction . [ 18 ] One recent study of \u03c9-gliadins demonstrated these gliadins are more similar to the bulk of oat avenins than \u03b1/\u03b2 or \u03b3 gliadins but , so far , oat avenins have not been linked to WDEIA . *$%^ may specifically induce WDEIA and certain chronic urticaria because the anti-gliadin IgE detects \u03c95-gliadins expressed by most of the Gli-B1 alleles but almost no responses prolamins extracted from rye or wheat/rye translocates . The Gli-B1 gene in *$%^ , Triticum aestivum comes from one of three progenitor species , Aegilops speltoides , indicating that nascent mutations on the B genome of *$%^ or from a small number of cultivated triticeae species . [ 19 ] Recent study of WDEIA shows that both aspirin and exercise increase the presence of gliadin in the blood stream [ 20 ] and the chronic induced behavior may extend to NSAIDs , MSG , Benzoate and other synthetic chemical food additives . Baker 's *$%^ has a \u03c9-gliadin component and thioredoxin hB component . [ 21 ] In addition , a gluten-extrinsic allergen has been identified as aspergillus amylase , added to flour to increase its baking properties . Contact sensitivity , [ 22 ] atopic dermatitis , [ 23 ] eczema , and urticaria appear to be related phenomena the cause of which is generally believed to be the hydrophobic prolamin components of certain Triticeae , Aveneae cultivars , in *$%^ one of these proteins is \u03c9-gliadin ( Gli-B1 gene product ) . A study of mothers and infants on an allergen-free diet demonstrated that these conditions can be avoided if *$%^ sensitive cohort in the population avoid *$%^ in the first year of life . [ 24 ] As with exercise induced anaphylaxis aspirin ( also : tartrazine , sodium benzoate , sodium glutamate ( MSG ) , sodium metabisulfite , tyramine ) may be sensitizing factors for reactivity . [ 25 ] Studies of the wheat-dependent exercise induced anaphylaxis demonstrate that atopy and EIA can be triggered from the ingestion of that aspirin and probably NSAIDs allow the entry of *$%^ proteins into the blood , where IgE reacts within allergens in the dermal tissues . Some individuals may be so sensitive that low dose aspirin therapy can increase risk for both atopy and WDEIA . *$%^ allergies were also common with contact dermatitis . A primary cause was the donning agent used for latex gloves prior to the 1990s , however most gloves now use protein free starch as donning agents . There appears to be an association of autoimmune rheumatoid arthritis ( ARA ) both with GSE and gluten allergies . [ 26 ] ARA in GSE/CD may be secondary to tTG autoimmunity . In a recent study in Turkey , 8 of 20 ARA patients had *$%^ reactivities on the RAST tests . When this allergic food and all other patient specific RAST+ foods were removed half of the patients had improved ARA by serological markers . In patients with *$%^ allergies , rye was effectively substituted . [ 27 ] This may indicate that some proportion of RA in GSE/CD is due to downstream effects of allergic responses . In addition , cross-reactive anti-beef-collagen antibodies ( IgG ) may explain some rheumatoid arthritis ( RA ) incidences . [ 28 ] Migraines . In the late 70s it was reported that people with migraines had reactions to food allergens , like ARA , the most common reaction was to *$%^ ( 78 % ) , orange , eggs , tea , coffee , chocolate , milk , beef , corn , cane sugar , and yeast . When 10 foods causing the most reactions were removed migraines fell precipitously , hypertension declined . [ 29 ] Some specific instances are attributed to *$%^ . [ 30 ] Autism .

Many patients get better and do not progress beyond this phase . A paralytic phase can follow if *$%^ continues ; in this phase , the abdominal pain becomes more widespread , the belly becomes more tender to the touch , and bowel motility decreases , resulting in abdominal bloating , no further bloody stools , and absent bowel sounds on exam . Finally , a shock phase can develop as fluids start to leak through the damaged colon lining . This can result in shock and metabolic acidosis with dehydration , low blood pressure , rapid heart rate , and confusion .
